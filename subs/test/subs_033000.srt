03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:11,279
## an unfair comparison you're not a lion and just 
## so you know lions are carnivores humans are not  




1708
03:30:11,279 --> 03:30:16,160
## we are herbivores one hundred percent up and 
## down you put a two-year-old child in a crib  




1709
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:21,120
## with a bunny rabbit and an apple let me know 
## when the child eats the bunny rabbit and plays  




1710
03:30:21,120 --> 03:30:26,559
## with the apple we are purely herbivorous we have 
## no carnivorous or omnivorous instincts whatsoever  




1711
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:31,760
## and physiologically if your jaw moves from side 
## to side in a grinding motion and you chew you're  




1712
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:36,479
## 100 herbivore if you were a meat-eater like a lion 
## your jaw would only go like this up and down rip  




1713
03:30:36,479 --> 03:30:41,759
## and swallow if you sweat through your pores to 
## cool yourself your herbivore what is your main  




1714
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:48,479
## purpose because most of the world won't become 
## vegan it depends on which day you ask me the world  




1715
03:30:48,479 --> 03:30:54,399
## injustice can't live forever the world will become 
## vegan one day just like just like every woman on  




1716
03:30:54,399 --> 03:31:01,040
## this planet will one day have their equality with 
## men just like one day all oppression will fall  




1717
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:06,319
## by the wayside injustice doesn't live forever and 
## it seems insurmountable don't get me wrong i mean  




1718
03:31:06,319 --> 03:31:11,679
## i'm in the trenches believe me it looks like it 
## seems like it can't happen but remember it took  




1719
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:19,040
## 400 years to convince white people in america 
## not to own black people you can see why this is  




1720
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:23,760
## taking so long we can't even treat each other 
## with kindness let alone treat the chickens and  




1721
03:31:23,760 --> 03:31:28,960
## the pigs and the turkeys and the insects of the 
## world with kindness but i think we can treat each  




1722
03:31:28,960 --> 03:31:33,760
## other with kindness one day once we learn how 
## to treat the animals with kindness you know i'm  




1723
03:31:34,399 --> 03:31:40,559
## i'm i'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable 
## because i just had a steak for lunch and um  




1724
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:49,359
## i and it's still i'm not convinced convinced 100 
## that i should stop eating meat for the rest of my  




1725
03:31:49,359 --> 03:31:56,960
## life it's not that i'm eating meat every day but 
## i do love my steak on the plate once a week so  




1726
03:31:56,960 --> 03:32:05,920
## you have now two minutes to try to convince me eat 
## meat once in once a month i don't want to convince  




1727
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:11,120
## you to do it once a month i want to convince you 
## never to do it okay you have to put yourself in  




1728
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:21,279
## the animal's position imagine that you were raped 
## to impregnate yourself okay somebody raped you to  




1729
03:32:21,279 --> 03:32:27,519
## impregnate you you gave birth to this baby this 
## baby was stolen from you at birth that baby was  




1730
03:32:27,520 --> 03:32:33,920
## fattened up with corn and soy and wheat and oats 
## that baby was put on a concentration camp truck  




1731
03:32:33,920 --> 03:32:40,319
## sent to a slaughterhouse hung upside down fully 
## conscious in front of all of her own species  




1732
03:32:41,520 --> 03:32:49,439
## screaming terrified in fear knife shoved into you 
## know her throat cut up into pieces where's the  




1733
03:32:49,439 --> 03:32:54,639
## justification for this and it's not your steak you 
## said my steak i'm very big on language that steak  




1734
03:32:54,640 --> 03:33:00,080
## was never yours okay that steak is a euphemism 
## by the way that's cow flesh that flesh belonged  




1735
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:06,640
## to another living being where do humans get off 
## owning and controlling living beings where do  




1736
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:10,960
## we get off thinking that we're the most special 
## thing that has ever existed on this planet when  




1737
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:17,680
## in reality we're the most unspecial thing that has 
## ever existed on this planet are you aware that if  




1738
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:22,720
## humans were removed from the planet the extinction 
## of humans would benefit everything that exists  




1739
03:33:23,279 --> 03:33:28,160
## are you also aware that if the bees died off 
## as we've been talking about this for about 10  




1740
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:34,800
## years in the news the whole system collapses 
## if the ants were exterminated the whole system  




1741
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:39,040
## would collapse this is how important and 
## special ants and bees are to the world  




1742
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:46,479
## why do we think we're better than they are 
## when they serve a vital role and we serve no  




1743
03:33:46,479 --> 03:33:51,040
## vital role whatsoever we're tormentors we're 
## oppressors where do you think it's come it's  




1744
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:56,239
## coming from the arrogance yeah i'm not sure i 
## don't know i don't know what has gotten into us  




1745
03:33:56,800 --> 03:34:01,120
## besides death and torture and murder i think 
## when you put violence in you get violence out  




1746
03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:06,479
## you consume discrimination and death you're 
## going to you know exude some people may say the  




1747
03:34:06,479 --> 03:34:12,080
## same things about you because some people may say 
## that he's arrogance he thinks that he knows better  




1748
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:18,960
## he thinks that he's better than us and actually 
## we're all actually um we're all let's say  




1749
03:34:20,399 --> 03:34:26,719
## how can i put it i'm i'm the one to be charged and 
## you are the the judge who is judging me right now  




1750
03:34:26,720 --> 03:34:29,920
## yeah and well there's two people in this world 
## there's there's people that judge and people  




1751
03:34:29,920 --> 03:34:34,399
## that lie about judging we judge people every 
## day we judge child molesters we judge rapists  




1752
03:34:34,399 --> 03:34:39,839
## we judge nazis uh we judge murderers um and i 
## know this is a shock to the meat dairy and egg  




1753
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:46,560
## eaters of the world but vegans are more ethical 
## than they are hands down and of course just like  




1754
03:34:46,560 --> 03:34:52,000
## a person that doesn't rape is more ethical than 
## a person who does rape a person who doesn't kill  




1755
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:56,960
## cows pigs chickens and turkeys is better than 
## a person who does a vegetarian hitler was not a  




1756
03:34:56,960 --> 03:35:01,840
## vegetarian that's a complete lie a complete and 
## utter lie from gerbils his propaganda minister
