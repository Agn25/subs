00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,160
## non-vegans aren't merely doing that non-vegans 
## are quite literally responsible for the shooting  




319
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,160
## for the enslavement for the torture and the 
## murder so contribution and support are not  




320
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,880
## accurate words to be using here responsibility 
## is the word to replace those words in all cases




321
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,880
## tie in the benefit tie into benefit 
## only once they concede by saying  




322
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,520
## if they're against animal abuse 
## then it's not possible to be against  




323
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,280
## animal abuse while being responsible for 
## it the number one benefit for being vegan  




324
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,160
## the benefit is that they no longer have 
## to be tortured and abused because of you  




325
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,400
## in other words you no longer have to be the reason 
## that animals suffer in the worst unimaginable ways  




326
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,240
## for you as an individual if you say 
## that you're against animal abuse  




327
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,880
## and what you see on the screens then when you're 
## vegan you no longer have to be a hypocrite




328
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,200
## now this is the part of the 
## interaction where things get very real  




329
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,040
## and where the person understands that you're not 
## just having a wishy-washy you're not just verbally  




330
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,560
## leafleting you're not just saying what vegans 
## tend to say you're having a real conversation  




331
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,160
## about a real issue here and you're calling 
## them out but you're not doing it because you  




332
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,200
## are trying to be an [ __ ] you also should 
## understand that telling somebody the truth is  




333
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,160
## the most compassionate thing that you can do it's 
## the most kind and loving thing that you can do  




334
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,800
## sometimes the truth can be harsh and can 
## sound brutal but you have to understand  




335
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,840
## that that's just the nature of truth the 
## truth is not always a bowl of cherries  




336
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,480
## and when you're a medium of truth you have 
## to accept that as part of your responsibility  




337
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,240
## when you're spreading the truth you have to 
## be comfortable with the fact that sometimes  




338
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,440
## it will sound brutal but you're not saying 
## it from a malicious place your intention  




339
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,120
## is to end animal abuse and to change the actions 
## of humans so that they are no longer responsible  




340
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,720
## for it in a way it's liberating for the human as 
## well as the animal who they are responsible for  




341
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,480
## oppressing so do you know what the number one 
## benefit is for being vegan can you take a guess




342
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,280
## yeah what do you think it is that as well yeah 
## yeah maybe it will help um like the industry  




343
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,800
## to not like produce as much yeah because you're 
## no longer demanding yeah and they are supplying  




344
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,800
## demand that's basic economics you're one less 
## person who's demanding it yeah let me put it  




345
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
## to you this way also the number one benefit for 
## the animals is that they're no longer tormented  




346
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,840
## abused and harmed in any way because of you 
## you're no longer the reason that animals  




347
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,040
## suffer immensely are tormented and murdered 
## the benefit for you as individuals also  




348
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
## is that when you say you're against animal 
## abuse you'll no longer be hypocrites  




349
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,600
## do you disagree with that does that does that 
## sound fair to you does that make sense to you  




350
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,560
## yeah this drives home the accountability and makes 
## them understand the consequences of their choices  




351
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,880
## so this is where you close the conversation always 
## end every outreach conversation by asking what the  




352
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,400
## individual will be personally doing to 
## take action ask the open-ended question  




353
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,840
## after our conversation what are you 
## going to do about this injustice  




354
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,880
## after a long conversation they may they may 
## still say that they'll only reduce or do nothing  




355
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,720
## or they may say something like i'll try to do 
## better if you can sense that the interaction will  




356
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,200
## keep going in circles end the conversation with 
## the statement but with people who say i'm going  




357
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,520
## to try to do better or i'll reduce how much meat i 
## eat they are still not getting how serious this is  




358
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,360
## do you deem this to be an injustice 
## and usually they will say yes i do  




359
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:35,040
## and then i say would you take the stance that you 
## just took with any other injustice you know if we  




360
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,600
## were talking about yourself as the victim in this 
## injustice would you find it acceptable for your  




361
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:48,560
## oppressor to say that they are going to try to 
## stop oppressing you or would you only deem it  




362
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,720
## acceptable for them to stop immediately so 
## what do you think you'll do about this then




363
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,760
## eat less medium yeah maybe even stop eventually  




364
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,600
## okay now is what you're seeing on the screens 
## is animal abuse and injustice to each of you
