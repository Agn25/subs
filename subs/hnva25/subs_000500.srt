00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
## when you're on the streets and people stop at 
## a cube you know they're not usually looking  




48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,000
## for something that's too deep when they interact 
## with you most people in terms of digesting this  




49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,720
## information will prefer for you to keep it simple 
## and keep the statistics and the facts to a minimum




50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,280
## if the goal were to provide information we would 
## hand out leaflets and magazines and brochures the  




51
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,760
## function of outreach is to make people understand 
## the consequences of their choices by holding them  




52
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,760
## accountable and centering the interaction about 
## what they can personally do about animal abuse  




53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:49,360
## on an individual level most people you speak with 
## will try to deflect from accountability and palm  




54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,760
## this off to governments or corporations and say 
## that they need to change or they might even start  




55
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,520
## talking about other human beings and say how are 
## you going to get the whole world to become vegan  




56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,320
## though these kinds of distractions that they 
## bring up are all to deflect from accountability  




57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,000
## individual accountability so it's your job as 
## an activist to bring it back to the individual  




58
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,120
## veganism is not about love or 
## compassion you can dislike animals




59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,280
## and you are still obligated to be vegan 
## in the same way that it applies to humans  




60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
## you can hate people but you don't have the 
## right to enslave torture and murder them  




61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,920
## veganism is about justice your likability 
## does not determine your rights so outreach  




62
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,120
## is not about how you or anyone else feels 
## about animals necessarily if you don't go  




63
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,200
## around beating children you aren't 
## instantly a compassionate individual  




64
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
## if you don't go around abusing animals on the 
## streets you're not necessarily a compassionate  




65
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,440
## person refraining from injustice does not make you 
## compassionate by default veganism is a non-action  




66
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,200
## therefore it's not loving it's merely the right 
## thing to do the same and rational thing to do




67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
## this approach that i'm teaching you is about pure 
## honesty telling someone the truth is the most  




68
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,040
## respectful thing that you can do for them when you 
## agree with every statement said by the bystander  




69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,400
## they will often lose respect for you and 
## you will lose control of the conversation  




70
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
## when you do this they see that your desire 
## to be validated by them is stronger than  




71
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
## your desire to end animal cruelty and the 
## whole reason why you're standing out on the  




72
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,640
## streets trying to engage with the public 
## thereby making a mockery of animal rights  




73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,360
## can you imagine if the primary goal of human 
## rights activists was to be liked by the oppressors  




74
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,280
## in any other context this would be insane




75
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,520
## you may be hesitant to speak boldly whenever you 
## are afraid to speak up for the animals directly  




76
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,320
## or if bystanders call you too extreme 
## place yourself in the victims position  




77
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,880
## and analyze your approach from their perspective 
## could you look a cow in the eyes and say i'm doing  




78
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,400
## my best on your behalf i'm speaking for you as 
## if i was in your position would you consider a  




79
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,880
## respectful yet direct conversation too extreme if 
## you were locked up in a slaughterhouse right now




80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,640
## don't talk about health and environment this 
## is obviously a huge thing in the animal rights  




81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,720
## movement vegans so often talk about human 
## health and the environment with an aim  




82
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,760
## to hook people in to becoming vegan and we 
## tell ourselves it doesn't matter how we get  




83
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,080
## people to go vegan just as long as they go 
## vegan the problem with this idea is that  




84
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
## more often than not it's a myth that these 
## people actually go vegan and if they do  




85
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,200
## become plant-based what they end up doing is 
## becoming the worst kind of candidate for a vegan  




86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,520
## because they are the type of vegans 
## to rub veganism through the mud on  




87
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:43,840
## the basis of doing it for their health or for 
## the environment both of which are human-centric  




88
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,240
## it's still a selfish message that you're 
## promoting which is completely beside the point  




89
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,280
## and not the basis for veganism the whole point 
## of veganism is altruism doing something for  




90
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
## non-human animals non-human animals deserve 
## to have a cause dedicated to them and so
