00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,320
## reason but what they're usually doing is they're 
## trying to deflect from accountability they're  




138
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,840
## trying to distract the conversation 
## so that they don't have to take action  




139
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,080
## so you have to understand that before 
## you entertain any of those points this  




140
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,520
## is another reason why you shouldn't bring 
## up health and environment talking points  




141
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
## and this is something i've learned time and time 
## again when i do bring up health and environment  




142
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,160
## if i entertain those points and i know that 
## sometimes it can be tempting super tempting  




143
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,600
## you will end up debating how much iron you 
## get as a vegan or whatever the case may be  




144
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
## all of it is just a distraction to 
## what really needs to be discussed




145
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
## not everybody on the streets is worth talking to 
## part of your role is to assess who is reachable  




146
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,680
## and who is not many people are not reachable this 
## is a numbers game i've had cubes where i've had  




147
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,200
## zero people take the issue seriously over the 
## course of three or four hours as part for the  




148
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,280
## course i've had cubes where almost every person 
## i spoke to was open and willing and they got it  




149
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,640
## plenty of those people that are open and worth 
## talking to are out there i also will say that  




150
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,640
## even if somebody doesn't get it and you've 
## said the correct thing on behalf of the animals  




151
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,920
## it is still worthwhile because you 
## never know what kind of an effect  




152
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,840
## what you've said will have 
## on that person's subconscious




153
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
## and you never know how that may come up again 
## within them in future if they want to have a  




154
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,600
## short conversation with you keep it short with 
## them don't entertain bystanders who want to engage  




155
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,920
## in long argumentative debates do not underestimate 
## the cunningness of non-vegan guilt and the ability  




156
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,160
## that many non-vegans will have to waste your vital 
## time at work for the animals if people don't take  




157
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:12,560
## this issue seriously expect that they will want 
## to waste your time they may even seem sincere  




158
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,360
## and nice they may seem like very sweet people but 
## if they don't take this issue seriously they may  




159
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:27,360
## just take you for a ride and waste your time when 
## people feel guilty and most people you speak with  




160
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,840
## by and large will feel guilty 
## when their guilt flares up  




161
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,960
## they will have all of these mechanisms that come 
## up to protect themselves or to defend themselves  




162
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,880
## and to justify their guilt and that's what 
## we mean by the cunningness of non-vegan guilt  




163
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
## you shouldn't underestimate it you should 
## understand that it's a very real thing  




164
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,960
## and it will cause humans to behave in 
## very irrational ways i've never seen  




165
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,360
## people act more irrationally that i have with 
## non-vegans when we address this issue with them




166
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:14,960
## so again activism is not sales sales training does 
## not equal good activism using slick talk to trick  




167
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,840
## people into veganism does not work your job is 
## to hold the bystander accountable it's up to  




168
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,880
## them which actions they take initially av made too 
## strong of a connection between sales and activism  




169
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,360
## tools taught in sales training only go so far 
## so this is why i'm making such a strong point  




170
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,120
## about the sales stuff it's because back in 2016 
## when we put together the model for the cube of  




171
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,360
## truth and the outreach element to the cube i did 
## actually make too strong of a connection between  




172
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,400
## sales and activism so this was back in 2016 that 
## i did this and i essentially called what i was  




173
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,360
## bringing to the table a value-based sales approach 
## and when i said a value-based sales approach i was  




174
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,680
## intending on differentiating from the 
## general regular form of sales that people  




175
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,320
## are commonly used to value based meaning 
## there is no money involved here however  




176
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,080
## what this did is it created this idea that if 
## you have 10 20 30 40 50 years of sales experience  




177
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,000
## that you're automatically experienced as an 
## activist and that's just not how this works at all  




178
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,720
## in fact what i've found is and i've personally 
## done sales for well over 10 years is a lot of what  




179
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,920
## i learned is not actually applicable most of what 
## i learned is not applicable in activism whatsoever  




180
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,840
## in fact a lot of the little tools that we did 
## bring over into activism we no longer really use  




181
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,440
## it's just good to understand how certain aspects 
## of sales work i just shared one thing with you  




182
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
## guys which is kiss keep it simple stupid i'm 
## not even sure if that belongs to the sales world
