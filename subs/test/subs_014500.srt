## feeling breathing beings animals are victims the 
## most oppressed ever and if you're having a tough  




842
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:16,000
## time grasping this fact maybe it's because 
## the only time you ever come into contact  




843
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,480
## with cows and chickens and turkeys is when 
## they're cut up and cooked on your dinner table  




844
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:35,040
## so good afternoon everybody my name is gary

## to define the word vegan for everybody v-e-g-a-n  




847
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:59,280
## vegans just like vegetarians do not consume the 
## meat of any land or marine animal vegans however  




848
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:08,960
## unlike vegetarians also refrain from eating cheese 
## milk eggs honey any animal product whatsoever  




849
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:19,120
## we also don't wear animal skin no fur leather wool 
## silk or down i want to let you know that i was not  




850
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:26,640
## raised vegan i ate meat cheese milk and eggs 
## for around 25 years and like most people  




851
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,440
## i always thought that i cared about 
## animals because i loved dogs and cats  




852
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:38,800
## who were chipmunks and squirrels until one day 
## after seeing some animals backstage at a circus  




853
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:44,480
## chained up and caged up i not only 
## realized that i was witnessing a slave show  




854
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:55,120
## i realized i was a hypocrite a bigot a speciesist 
## just like a racist who believes that their race is  




855
01:46:55,120 --> 01:47:02,320
## more special and more important than all the other 
## races a speciesist believes that humans are more  




856
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:09,280
## special and more important than all the animals 
## and therefore have the right to enslave and kill  




857
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:16,320
## any species they choose but if you honestly 
## place yourself in the animal's position  




858
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,920
## looking at this issue from the victim's point 
## of view being denied your freedom and the right  




859
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:30,320
## to live a long healthy life and then imagine 
## yourself confined in a concentration camp truck  




860
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,040
## on your way to a slaughterhouse so someone could 
## slice your throat and cut you up into pieces  




861
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,160
## i'm pretty sure you would understand 
## why the psychotic addictions of meat  




862
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:49,600
## cheese milk and eggs must be abolished if you eat 
## animals and the things that come out of animals  




863
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:56,400
## you are intentionally causing pain and suffering 
## and polluting your soul with the blood of innocent  




864
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:05,680
## beings humanity's main focus should always be 
## extending compassion to others not engaging in  




865
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:13,600
## rituals and traditions that are based on cruelty 
## there's a massacre taking place right now it's the  




866
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:21,600
## world's largest and longest-running massacre of 
## all time because every second of every minute of  




867
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:29,680
## every hour of every day female animals are raped 
## to impregnate them so we can steal their babies  




868
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,840
## separate families from each other so we 
## can kill them and sell their flesh and skin  




869
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:43,520
## if that's not the definition of injustice 
## of an atrocity then i'd like to know what is  




870
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,960
## you do realize that if you went to the 
## nearest cow or chicken slaughterhouse  




871
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,960
## and remove the animals and then 
## replace them with human beings




872
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:01,680
## all of a sudden it's a tragedy auschwitz 
## is resurrected slave ships sail again  




873
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:08,240
## and don't think i'm the first person to make 
## these valid comparisons civil rights activist  




874
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:14,480
## dick gregory once said when i look at animals 
## held captive by circuses i think of slavery  




875
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:22,720
## animals and circuses represent domination and 
## oppression they wear the same chains and shackles  




876
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:32,640
## isaac bashevis singer who escaped nazi occupied 
## poland once condemned our speciesistic world when  




877
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:40,400
## he said what do they know all these scholars all 
## these philosophers all the leaders of the world  




878
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:49,200
## they have convinced themselves that man the worst 
## transgressor of all the species is the crown of  




879
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:56,800
## creation and all the animals were made for us to 
## be food and pelts to be tormented and exterminated  




880
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:09,840
## in relation to animals all humans are nazis 
## for the animals it is an eternal treblinka
