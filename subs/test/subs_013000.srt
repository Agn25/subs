01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:09,600
## and finally to top off the barbarity their 
## testicles are ripped out as well oh in order  




702
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:14,080
## to mark them to keep track of them they have 
## holes punched in their ears it's called ear notch  




703
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,960
## can you imagine being hated so vehemently 
## that someone would rip out portions of your  




704
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:26,400
## ear or castrate you or cut your teeth off 
## down to the gum line all without anesthetic




705
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:34,480
## did you know that the animal welfare act of the 
## 1960s which happens to be a pathetic piece of  




706
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:39,760
## legislation kind of like our constitution when it 
## was first created which left out many more humans  




707
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,120
## than it ever led in originally the animal welfare 
## act unequivocally allows people to torture  




708
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,600
## enslave terrorize and murder all animals even 
## endangered ones if you apply for the proper permit  




709
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,160
## the animal welfare act is a how-to guide 
## to animal exploitation torture them this  




710
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,000
## way don't torture them that way and slave them 
## like this don't enslave them like that and kill  




711
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,520
## them this way don't kill them that way circuses 
## slaughterhouses and research labs love to say  




712
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,640
## hey gary hey peta leave us alone we're in 
## complete compliance with the animal welfare act  




713
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,960
## well my dear friends you'd have to be a vicious 
## idiot not to be in compliance with the animal  




714
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:26,000
## welfare act once again since the basis 
## of the awa is torture terror and murder  




715
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:34,320
## how could an animal exploiter not be in compliance 
## the awa's mandate for food and water does not ease  




716
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:40,960
## the terror nor stop the murder smithfield 
## the number one killer of pigs in the world  




717
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:47,920
## generates 8 billion dollars every year by 
## killing eleven hundred pigs every hour in  




718
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:56,000
## fact smithfield's five biggest concentration 
## camps kills 78 000 pigs every day you know what  




719
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,720
## government agencies in charge of enforcing the 
## awa the u.s department of agriculture the same  




720
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,400
## agency that oversees the murder of 10 billion 
## land animals seem a little incongruous why don't  




721
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:13,760
## we put pedophiles in charge of child protection 
## laws misogynist in charge of domestic abuse laws  




722
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:21,120
## and hunters in charge of wildlife management my 
## bad we do that one already little sidebar for you  




723
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:28,000
## every single state and national wildlife agency 
## is run solely by hunters and hunt supporters  




724
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,480
## period point blank there are no animal 
## rights humanitarians on these committees  




725
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:38,320
## you know how the hunting community always claims 
## that killing animals is sound scientific wildlife  




726
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:43,680
## management if that were the case and 
## how come in every single newspaper  




727
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:50,320
## in the usa hunting stories are always placed 
## in the sports section not the science section




728
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,360
## of the 10 billion land animals killed for food  




729
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,080
## chickens represent 9 billion with 
## another 250 million enslaved on egg farms  




730
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,680
## now raised in huge buildings these factory farm 
## warehouses enslave anywhere from 5 thousand  




731
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,920
## to eighty thousand birds in one building eighteen 
## by twenty inch battery cages for the egg length  




732
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,680
## tens while the chickens the males are 
## strewn about in a chaotic free-for-all  




733
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:25,680
## the tiny battery cages are a staple of the egg 
## industry where 5 to 11 birds share one cage but  




734
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:31,280
## inside or outside of the cage these places 
## of horror deny natural behaviors to chickens  




735
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:38,480
## and hens like dust bathing preening and happily 
## roaming freely something we all take for granted




736
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:46,640
## for the record hens prefer more space than 18 
## by 20 inches and chickens do not like to live  




737
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,000
## in groups larger than 30. therefore fighting 
## is common in the chicken and egg industries  




738
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,040
## how do they treat the fighting problem two ways 
## one ignore the situation two vicious intervention  




739
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,760
## chickens and hens are de-beaked 
## meaning the sensitive portion  




740
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,280
## top two-thirds of the beak is seared off with 
## a red hot blade heated to 800 degrees celsius  




741
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:15,120
## egg laying hens are shot off with so many 
## antibiotics they're forced to lay up to 300 eggs  




742
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:22,240
## every year because of this their uteruses have 
## been known to bleed and protrude from their bodies




743
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,680
## when hens can't keep up with the demands of the 
## egg industry they don't go to sanctuaries people  




744
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:36,560
## they're sent to slaughterhouses and killed let's 
## not forget that egg farms have to breed birds  




745
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:42,640
## so there's always a fresh supply of hens to lay 
## eggs but upon hatching if those babies turn out  




746
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:47,680
## to be males in the egg industry they're considered 
## useless to the egg industry because they don't lay  




747
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:54,240
## eggs only females can do that so male babies are 
## put in plastic bags suffocated tossed in the trash  




748
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,280
## or they're thrown into huge rendering 
## machines where their live bodies are ground up  




749
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:05,760
## and used as feed bottom line whether it's an egg 
## length and a factory farmed chicken a free-range
