01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,920
## i did not come here today to try and convince you 
## that animals are more important than human beings  




654
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,480
## because the issue of importance is 
## irrelevant to how animals should be treated  




655
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,320
## no one in this movement has ever said that a 
## mouse is more important than your mother your  




656
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,120
## father your sister or your brother because we 
## don't make an arbitrary list of who's important  




657
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:33,280
## and we don't care about anyone else's arbitrary 
## list of who's more important we care about peace  




658
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:44,960
## justice the mahatma mohandas gandhi once said this 
## i do not regard flesh food as necessary to us i  




659
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:50,880
## hold fresh food to be unsuited to our species the 
## life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a  




660
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,360
## human being i should be unwilling to take the life 
## of a lamb for the sake of the human body the more  




661
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,280
## helpless the creature is the more it is entitled 
## to protection from humans from the cruelty of  




662
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:09,440
## humans gandhi was just one of many luminaries 
## throughout history who adopted the animal rights  




663
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,840
## lifestyle he was a true humanitarian who opened 
## up his circle of compassion to include animals not  




664
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,360
## exclude them other people throughout history who 
## adopted the animal rights lifestyle and practice  




665
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,600
## vegetarianism and veganism pythagoras plato 
## socrates einstein george bernard shaw schweitzer  




666
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:34,160
## harry feature stone percy shelley tolstoy 
## da vinci and cesar chavez just to name a few  




667
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,320
## around six years ago when i fully embraced 
## the peaceful philosophy of animal rights  




668
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,600
## and understood that animals had an inherent right 
## to be free and live completely unfettered by human  




669
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,440
## dominance i wondered why it took me more than 
## 20 years to attain this non-violent awakening  




670
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,480
## i asked myself who taught me that animals were put 
## on this earth for food who taught me to disrespect  




671
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,680
## animals and view them as mere commodities who 
## stole my compassion my empathy and my conscience  




672
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,640
## who lied to me who instilled that vicious 
## mindset of human to animal exploitation  




673
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:13,360
## as standard operating procedure each and every 
## person in this room should ask those same  




674
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,960
## questions think deeply about that who taught that 
## violence to you who told you that animals should  




675
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,840
## be your food your clothing your entertainment and 
## your research specimens who lied to you who took  




676
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,280
## your compassion your empathy and your conscience 
## who gave you the belief system that embraces the  




677
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:38,000
## misery and murder of innocent animals was it your 
## parents your friends your institutions of learning  




678
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,320
## your government your religion i'm sure you'll 
## find just like i did that it was one or more of  




679
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,640
## those aforementioned entities who taught you and 
## me to believe endless lies for they too have been  




680
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:59,040
## lied to or they will benefit from those lies i'm 
## asking everyone to reevaluate your belief system  




681
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,880
## ask yourself why is this violence 
## being permitted for what reasons  




682
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,880
## and i hope you'll have the same revelation 
## that i did the non-violence through veganism  




683
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,880
## non-violence through animal liberation is the only 
## ethical and acceptable way to live on this planet  




684
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:25,360
## let's begin a formal discussion on veganism and 
## don't forget after the talk check out govege.com  




685
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,560
## last year in the u.s alone 10 billion cows 
## pigs chickens turkeys and other animals  




686
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,280
## were raised in concentration camps euphemistically 
## referred to as factory farms they were sent to  




687
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,840
## slaughterhouses where knife-wielding carnivores 
## hang them upside down slit their throats drain  




688
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,680
## their blood and dismember their bodies then 
## because most people have acquired a taste for  




689
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:56,880
## animal flesh i stress acquired taste for animal 
## flesh their dismembered bodies were cooked  




690
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,160
## and eaten did you know that sows 
## female pigs are forced to live  




691
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,560
## their entire lives and give birth in 
## gestation crates and farrowing stalls  




692
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,200
## these prisons are so tiny a simple task like 
## turning around is a fantasy to a female pig now  




693
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,880
## this intense confinement slowly drives her insane 
## and she ends up exhibiting neuronic behaviors like  




694
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,840
## bar biting where she bites the metal bars that 
## can find her all day long she bites these bars  




695
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:30,080
## in the slightly larger areas where the male pigs 
## the hogs are kept other neuronic behaviors occur  




696
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:36,720
## fighting is common because of overcrowding and 
## when pigs fight they've been known to attack  




697
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:42,080
## each other's tails so how does the pig industry 
## solve the fighting problem two ways one ignore  




698
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:49,440
## the situation two vicious intervention first pigs 
## have their tails chopped off without anesthetic  




699
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:56,320
## then in a depraved attempt to reduce the 
## effects of industry induced aggression pigs  




700
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:02,960
## have up to eight teeth chopped off down to the 
## gum line with a pair of wire cutter-like devices
