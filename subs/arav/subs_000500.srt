00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,320
## or was it just a we request that you 
## do this well it seemed like it was  




52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:21,280
## out of the uh concern for joey's image 
## or his uh reputation yeah so so far to  




53
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,040
## get it straight there the requirements so the 
## requirements for the donor to continue funding av  




54
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,840
## are that you delete those videos um give 
## them uh of some i don't know financial  




55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,320
## organization access to all of your records 
## um is the board of directors things still  




56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
## going they still want you to do that as well is 
## that still on the cards or did they pull that  




57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,040
## like well here's the thing you know there were 
## things mentioned in the email that we got from  




58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,840
## the donor but we don't even know what exactly are 
## the expectations on on their side and so that's  




59
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,760
## why we wanted to have a conversation with them 
## but at this point at this point we're not getting  




60
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,040
## we're not getting that do you think it's possible 
## that they did that to save a face as in they  




61
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,800
## that joey was involved and gave that response 
## to try to kind of yeah save face basically would  




62
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
## that be that's fair to say or do you think that 
## that he actually or she i don't know the donor  




63
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,920
## didn't they actually want to rectify things or 
## is it just to try to repair some of the damage  




64
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:29,360
## to the reputation of joey and the donor i mean 
## even in my most charitable of moods towards this




65
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,760
## i can't see it any other way 
## yeah it feels like that i mean  




66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,280
## from an outside perspective unfortunately it 
## does feel like it was just an attempt to maybe uh  




67
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,760
## i don't know get the upper hand take the high road 
## you know or appear to be taking the high road but  




68
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,000
## it's it's really sad to hear that actually 
## it's you you actually took the decision to  




69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
## take the high road with them and then they just 
## didn't respond which um yeah it's disappointing  




70
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:09,360
## when we heard that there was this interest to 
## continue funding us and have another conversation  




71
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:18,160
## then we're like great let's have a conversation 
## but then you know we're not going to be bored  




72
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,720
## and bossed around and that's not what we designed 
## a v for it's in fact the opposite of that  




73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,840
## and that's part of the reason 
## why we're at this point  




74
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,160
## that we're at and the reason why we 
## have an organic following and you know  




75
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,160
## it's i think there's just a misunderstanding 
## of what we do from the donor's perspective  




76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
## and i think that they don't really understand 
## that work and they don't really understand us  




77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,760
## and what our mission is and and they they perhaps 
## got involved without doing their homework and  




78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,320
## we wanted to have a conversation so that we 
## could get on the same page about things and  




79
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,480
## we're not able to do that at this point so that's 
## where everything is left at this point yeah  




80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,080
## i understand i understand and it's it's it's 
## something that it's not a surprise that that  




81
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,640
## the donor or anyone basically is having some 
## kind of uh you know let's say strong opinion  




82
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,160
## towards being like kind of anti-av this seems 
## to be quite a common thing right now and i was  




83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,880
## just thinking about it earlier about what kind 
## of an example could i give you know to uh like  




84
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,520
## i don't know an analogy to give and um it's kind 
## of funny i don't know if you'll agree with me but  




85
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,400
## i feel like av has become kind of like 
## the nickelback of animal rights it's like  




86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
## i'm sorry i'm sorry but nickelback 
## are extremely successful




87
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
## awards end this stream




88
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,720
## nickelback has won loads of awards they play loads 
## of gigs they're very successful they've got loads  




89
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,400
## of fans but it's also very in to hate them it's 
## almost like a trend to hate them right and that's  




90
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,800
## what i'm kind of getting at here is that it's not 
## a surprise to me that someone is holding really  




91
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,440
## negative opinions without even considering what 
## you're doing because that's the in thing to do  




92
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,840
## that's the kind of point i was making it seems 
## cool like when i put out some messages asking  




93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,720
## people hey you know give me some questions for 
## av i had a few people just replying just just  




94
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,240
## with some you know real virtue signaling stuff 
## like just really like just explaining why they  




95
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,840
## won't go for av anymore and i'm like that's great 
## but like give me a question like give me something  




96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,040
## you know it just seems like it's cool to say i 
## don't work with av i it seems cool to be like that  




97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,600
## like it's cool to say i hate nickelback i'm sorry 
## to put you in that bracket but it really feels  




98
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,800
## like that you know uh i've got to say and and that 
## brings me on to go on go on sorry i think it's a  




99
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,880
## lot cooler though yeah i mean come on chad kroger 
## is not that that much of a loser is he come on  




100
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,840
## no i used to listen to them when i was younger 
## i have to admit i i i know it seems like it's uh
