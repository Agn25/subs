01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,720
## now i know these statements sound 
## pretty harsh and controversial to you  




882
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:23,280
## but that doesn't mean they aren't true the fact 
## that anyone would fight against veganism against  




883
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:29,600
## animal liberation which means you are against 
## compassion just proves how completely irrational  




884
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:38,320
## meat dairy and egg eaters can be vegans 
## are only asking you to change what you eat  




885
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:48,640
## not who you are stay jewish christian or catholic 
## stay muslim buddhist hindu atheist agnostic stay  




886
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:54,160
## left or right in politics if you honestly 
## place yourself in the animal's position  




887
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:00,400
## there's no way you can justify the things that 
## we do to them and walk away from today's speech  




888
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:07,120
## saying that you don't care the ethical compass 
## that most people use to gauge right from wrong  




889
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:15,040
## is the golden rule do unto others as you 
## would have others do unto you since no one  




890
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:20,480
## in this room wants to be treated the way we treat 
## cows and pigs and chickens and turkeys and fish  




891
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:28,880
## there's no need to search for an excuse 
## today not to be vegan 60 billion land animals  




892
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:39,440
## 90 billion marine animals are killed every year on 
## this planet for a sandwich for addictions of greed  




893
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:49,200
## and gluttony what kind of society justifies mass 
## murder stop thinking that animals aren't victims  




894
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:56,960
## because they aren't human it's the mindset of the 
## victimizer that's wrong and this is what needs to  




895
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:04,080
## be examined and corrected because it never changes 
## no matter who the victim is have you noticed it  




896
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:10,240
## always goes something like this no you don't count 
## no you don't matter no i'm more important than you  




897
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:14,880
## i laugh at the suffering i inflict on you i'll 
## kill you and your family whenever i want however i  




898
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:26,240
## want prove to me why i should be kind to you it is 
## not your right to deny someone else their freedom  




899
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:33,520
## and their rights so you can harm them enslave them 
## and kill them that's not what rights are about  




900
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:43,200
## that's injustice there is no counter argument 
## to veganism except that you can't be right all  




901
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:51,200
## the time apologize for the way you've been 
## living make amends and evolve move forward  




902
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,320
## now all throughout history there's a pretty 
## good reason why most people most good people  




903
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:03,840
## have always been on the wrong side of what's 
## right and that's because the truth has never been  




904
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:12,640
## accepted overnight it always has to pass through 
## three stages first it is mocked and ridiculed  




905
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:20,800
## second stage denial and violent opposition 
## people refuse people refuse to believe there's  




906
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:27,920
## an atrocity taking place and they fight tooth 
## and nail to keep the status quo as is third stage




907
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:37,600
## acceptance there is no longer need to explain 
## it because we all get it now unfortunately it  




908
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:44,480
## usually takes hundreds sometimes thousands of 
## years for the truth to pass through these stages  




909
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,320
## i'm going to try and do it 
## today in around 45 minutes  




910
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:54,880
## and in order for the truth to be accepted and 
## understood we do have to witness the atrocities  




911
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:00,400
## the five and a half minute video we're about to 
## watch that footage was taken throughout america  




912
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,800
## britain and israel and if you feel the need to 
## turn away or close your eyes during this video  




913
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,400
## you should probably ask yourself a question 
## if it's not good enough for my eyes  




914
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:19,360
## then why is it good enough for my stomach and 
## before i press play i have to say something about  




915
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:26,640
## all this humane meat humane milk humane eggs [ 
## __ ] that's going on in our society right now  




916
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:34,320
## that stuff does not exist under any circumstances 
## whatsoever even when animals reside in cage-free  




917
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:42,080
## free range grass-fed local organic antibiotic-free 
## facilities by definition alone slavery and  




918
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:48,080
## slaughter are radically cruel and can never 
## be humane so don't be so gullible with slick  




919
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:53,760
## marketing ads that want to convince you that 
## animals enjoy being on the menu as if they're  




920
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:00,720
## all saying hey stab me yeah kill me sure take 
## everything from me because that's why i'm here
