00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,680
## way it's not speciesism because i'm not doing 
## it because of the species i'm doing it because  




491
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,840
## of the severity of the situation we've never 
## even said the term animals first human second  




492
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,320
## like that's come from other people we've 
## never said that before right right what we've  




493
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:26,400
## never said is animals deserve to have a cause 
## dedicated solely to them and so av will be that




494
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,880
## sure i actually i i don't know if i've ever heard 
## you say that i don't think i don't think i have  




495
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,960
## and something but some people have messaged 
## that so if anyone's watching right now and you  




496
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,200
## you feel like you have some evidence of that then 
## you're more than welcome to send it and we'll  




497
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,840
## discuss it and you know but i i yeah it's it's 
## something that does keep coming up and that goes  




498
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,800
## for other things by the way if you're watching 
## now and we we go through something and and you  




499
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,560
## know but we discuss our poorness i've never said 
## that or this has not happened and you think it has  




500
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,480
## you just send me a message with what you think has 
## happened or within with evidence of it and we'll  




501
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,360
## we'll talk about it right now we're not we're not 
## here to hide away from things and you know paul  




502
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,480
## and us how you agreed to come on here to actually 
## directly face some of these things you know so if  




503
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
## anyone does have something that they feel should 
## be directly faced just send it me on instagram or  




504
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,200
## a messenger or email or you know tag tag me in 
## the comments and tell me you're gonna send it on  




505
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,480
## messenger or whatever and i'll and i'll pick it 
## up and we'll bring it up on the screen and we'll  




506
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,720
## talk about it like we're not we're not hiding 
## anything but i've got a sneaky suspicion that  




507
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,840
## that's not gonna happen because most of the stuff 
## we're talking about is just rumor and you know  




508
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,320
## it's i don't think there's a lot 
## of evidence behind it to be honest  




509
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:44,960
## um yeah but um let's let's i think we're still on 
## intersectionality and i think i feel like we maybe  




510
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,640
## want to delve into that just a little bit further 
## um i guess what i guess your guys stance on it i  




511
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,840
## mean somebody asked the question here saying what 
## are you doing to make your activism intersectional  




512
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:01,200
## somebody asked that uh of you guys and and i was 
## thinking like how can i really ask that because i  




513
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,280
## don't i don't know if it's something that you 
## actually are trying to do um i don't i know  




514
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,800
## that there was a i know there was a change of 
## direction recently as to i don't know not be so  




515
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,680
## i don't know what the word is to be more sensitive 
## i think with your own words um because maybe in  




516
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,600
## the past there was a little bit of insensitivity 
## but i guess yeah what would you say to someone  




517
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,840
## who's asking you that how what are you doing 
## to make your activism more intersectional  




518
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,840
## we're not trying to do that like you said but 
## that's not the goal there's no need for us to  




519
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:38,960
## try to do that and let's just cut the [ __ ] here 
## people who say this are not actually asking us  




520
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,280
## to adopt anti-oppression values within 
## our organization because we already have  




521
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:53,760
## those what they're asking us to do is become 
## activists for human related issues and we are  




522
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:02,640
## dedicated to non-human animals sorry not sorry 
## so you draw you draw a line i guess uh between  




523
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,440
## not contributing to other oppressions 
## are they drawing a line sorry between  




524
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,960
## not contributing to other oppressions and being 
## active for other oppressions and they feel that  




525
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,080
## because you are on the not contributing side 
## of the line that therefore means that you are  




526
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,320
## wrong and that you should be actually active 
## for those oppressions too correct they want us  




527
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:28,560
## to be on the streets showing footage of 
## what's happening in the blm movement or




528
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,920
## with regards to homelessness or feminism or 
## i guess whatever the mainstream issue is of  




529
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,920
## the times but going back to what you were 
## saying earlier about like the definition of  




530
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:49,200
## intersectionality it actually doesn't apply here 
## because sure you can be an animal rights activist  




531
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,840
## you can also be a human rights activist in what 
## that whatever area you want to work in but um  




532
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,800
## what's the relationship between like any of those 
## things that you mentioned and animals suffering  




533
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,800
## you know what i mean there is no relationship 
## so i i don't think it actually makes sense  




534
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:17,840
## to ask that of us so how are we gonna make it 
## work with that even if that was something we  




535
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:24,400
## were looking at doing how are you gonna connect 
## homelessness to animal suffering in the meat  




536
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,280
## dairy and egg industry i mean we get asked to 
## speak up about various issues and it is really  




537
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:40,240
## only about what is popular at that time what is 
## being spoken about at that time and it's not about  




538
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,520
## these issues that cause a vast number of deaths 
## around the world for example in the middle east  




539
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:55,120
## that never gets spoken about that we're aware 
## of because we have heritage in the middle east  




540
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,360
## we know about these things these people for 
## example who were outraged about what was going on
