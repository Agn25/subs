## i will start like we said you affected millions 
## and millions of people around the world  




1667
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:28,240
## why is it so effective here in israel 
## how come that it's catching in israel  




1668
03:26:29,520 --> 03:26:33,201
## i'm not clearly sure why but 
## the only thing that i can  




1669
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:40,080
## figure out is that over the years as i've talked 
## to tens of thousands of people i've noticed that  




1670
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:48,000
## people who have been oppressed jews hispanics 
## women blacks they always respond better to  




1671
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:52,479
## this revolution that i'm involved in because 
## they understand oppression they've been through  




1672
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:55,919
## it they know what it's like to be treated 
## like nothing like their lives don't matter  




1673
03:26:56,560 --> 03:27:01,200
## so that's what i think is going on here jews 
## have been an oppressed people for thousands of  




1674
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:07,279
## years we understand oppression and we're supposed 
## to not support it so i'm just pointing this out  




1675
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:12,559
## to everybody because people don't realize how much 
## they're harming animals in their daily lives so as  




1676
03:27:12,560 --> 03:27:18,479
## i point out the steak the hamburger the chicken 
## sandwich that you're eating the schnitzel okay  




1677
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:24,639
## these these pieces of meat came off the bodies of 
## living animals who didn't want to be murdered who  




1678
03:27:24,640 --> 03:27:30,239
## didn't want to suffer and die who didn't want 
## to be tormented so once i pointed out to people  




1679
03:27:30,239 --> 03:27:36,719
## most people same people logical people make that 
## next step to veganism we like to use euphemisms  




1680
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:42,319
## which is why these atrocities take place so we 
## always want to say leather when it's cow skin  




1681
03:27:42,319 --> 03:27:49,279
## and we want to say even even the term bacon 
## what's bacon you mean pig flesh so once you  




1682
03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:54,479
## start thinking about what we're wearing and what 
## we're eating again this is why i say sane people  




1683
03:27:54,479 --> 03:27:59,919
## will make a choice towards veganism it makes no 
## sense because if you let's put it this way i like  




1684
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:04,800
## to explain how this is the biggest holocaust that 
## has ever existed people get upset at those terms  




1685
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:09,439
## i have to tell you that i am upset about 
## hearing like holocaust comparing the holocaust  




1686
03:28:09,439 --> 03:28:16,319
## to like every single person that that heard your 
## lectures and to hear this holocaust comparing it  




1687
03:28:16,319 --> 03:28:23,040
## to animals it's a little bit limited and you know 
## what and i'm not even jewish okay but it's hurts  




1688
03:28:23,040 --> 03:28:28,640
## me well let me explain how how this this holocaust 
## is actually worse i'm offended that we compare  




1689
03:28:28,640 --> 03:28:33,120
## human holocaust to the animal holocaust which is 
## the biggest holocaust in the history of humankind  




1690
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:38,800
## if you went to the nearest cow or chicken 
## slaughterhouse and remove the animals  




1691
03:28:38,800 --> 03:28:43,920
## and replace them with jews you have now 
## recreated auschwitz there's no difference  




1692
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:50,800
## you have a building that exists to dismantle to 
## torment to torture and murder innocent beings  




1693
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:56,720
## let's play a time game war a time warp game ghosts 
## go back 60 70 years you go back to auschwitz or  




1694
03:28:56,720 --> 03:29:00,800
## you go back to birkenau you remove the jews 
## and replace them with cows and chickens  




1695
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:06,240
## you still have a holocaust taking place 
## this in fact we learn how to kill jews  




1696
03:29:07,040 --> 03:29:11,200
## in the hall like the nazis did because they 
## studied what the meat industry was doing  




1697
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:15,599
## we've learned how to torture and kill each 
## other because we practiced on the animals first  




1698
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:22,480
## but animals are eating animals some animals 
## 75 of animals on this planet are herbivores  




1699
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:28,479
## but the it's it's part of our circle of life now 
## this is the circle of torture and death when you  




1700
03:29:28,479 --> 03:29:34,639
## see uh a lion eating a zebra it's it's blue and 
## you're but i noticed you have clothes on and i  




1701
03:29:34,640 --> 03:29:39,520
## noticed that you have a cell phone and you have a 
## computer it is unfair to pick one thing that lions  




1702
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:43,840
## do that you want to mimic when you don't want 
## to mimic anything else they do when lions walk  




1703
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:48,160
## up and greet each other they sniff each other's 
## ass when i came in this room you did not kneel  




1704
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:55,200
## down and sniff my ass okay lions sometimes kill 
## their young when their runts okay if a human being  




1705
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:59,279
## killed their baby because they didn't want him we 
## arrest them and charge them with murder could you  




1706
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:05,759
## go to a courtroom and say hey but your honor lions 
## kill their babies can't i it's a survivor it's
