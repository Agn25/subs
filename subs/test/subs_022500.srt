02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:37,840
## uh




1139
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:51,840
## um




1140
02:25:54,640 --> 02:26:05,840
## so




1141
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:47,840
## thank you




1142
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:01,840
## down




1143
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:15,840
## so




1144
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:29,840
## so




1145
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:51,120
## now not that any law could ever alleviate 
## the suffering and slaughter that you folks  




1146
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:56,399
## just witnessed but i want to read an excerpt to 
## everyone right now from the animal welfare act  




1147
02:27:56,399 --> 02:28:05,200
## of 1966 this is a pathetic piece of legislation 
## if and i say if if you can even call this a law  




1148
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:12,880
## because the animal welfare act states verbatim 
## that the term animal excludes birds rats  




1149
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:22,240
## mice horses and other farm animals such as but not 
## limited to livestock and poultry and anything used  




1150
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:30,800
## or intended to be used as food or clothing it also 
## states that the term exhibitor excludes retail pet  




1151
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:38,720
## stores organizations sponsoring state and county 
## fairs livestock shows rodeos purebred dog and cat  




1152
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:45,040
## shows and any fair or exhibition intended 
## to advance agricultural arts and sciences  




1153
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:51,040
## that's some law they've laid out for the animals 
## but even if this animal welfare act decided to  




1154
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:55,439
## include all of the animals you just heard 
## it leaves out i want to be clear about this  




1155
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:03,600
## there is no peaceful compassionate way to shoot an 
## animal between their eyes or slice their throats  




1156
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:10,160
## it is the taking of an animal's life that is the 
## ultimate violation all of the mutilations that  




1157
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:15,680
## happen to these animals along the way which we're 
## going to discuss in a moment only serve to prove  




1158
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:21,439
## that animals have been reduced to objects they 
## are mere commodities that have to meet certain  




1159
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:28,319
## specifications in order to maximize profits and 
## during this speech when we say the word farm we  




1160
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:34,960
## are not just speaking about factory farms we are 
## talking about all farms factory free range organic  




1161
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:43,280
## and mom-and-pop farms because all farms that raise 
## animals for food kill animals for food so all we  




1162
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:48,080
## ask from here on out is that you folks give us 
## an open mind and truly hear what we're about to  




1163
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:55,920
## tell you now each year in the us we kill about 10 
## billion land animals and 18 billion marine animals  




1164
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:03,439
## because people have acquired a taste for meat 
## and i stress acquired a taste for meat worldwide
