02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,840
## is




1367
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:19,040
## foreign hello gary good afternoon welcome 
## to the show uh glad to have you here uh  




1368
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:25,600
## quite an astonishing relationship with the israeli 
## community you are developing right absolutely  




1369
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:30,880
## beautiful tell me about it i mean it's amazing 
## what's going on here people are listening to the  




1370
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:35,680
## speech it's the most viewed speech in the history 
## of israel which is pretty amazing considering  




1371
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:42,800
## what's been going on here for the last 50 60 70 
## years i find that people who have been oppressed  




1372
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:46,080
## certainly understand oppression more 
## than others so i think that's why  




1373
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:49,279
## israelis are really taking to 
## this message of animal liberation  




1374
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:55,439
## and it's thrilling to know that people are paying 
## attention and making massive change try to compare  




1375
02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:01,359
## it to to what's happening in other places like in 
## the states or in europe can you compare it well  




1376
02:57:01,359 --> 02:57:06,559
## it's definitely more people are paying attention 
## here than in america america does have a lot of  




1377
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:11,600
## vegan food a lot of vegan mock meats a lot of 
## vegan dairy products so there's more vegan food  




1378
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:18,160
## there but more people seem to be interested in 
## veganism here more people are making that change  




1379
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:23,840
## though i understand that you didn't get permission 
## to speak in front of high school students it's  




1380
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:27,840
## kind of par for the course same thing back in 
## america it's really not different here but it is  




1381
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:33,520
## it is sad that we can't talk to kids about the 
## truth about what's going on in the world that we  




1382
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:39,760
## treat these teenagers like they're babies they're 
## not babies they need to understand what's going on  




1383
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:45,359
## and when you hide the truth from people then you 
## have atrocities yeah maybe maybe but maybe the  




1384
02:57:45,359 --> 02:57:51,359
## right place is not in schools but you know after 
## afternoon lectures and evening lectures might be  




1385
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:58,399
## so who is your audience in the states in 
## israel mainly in the states yes college  




1386
02:57:58,399 --> 02:58:04,000
## students for sure college students i only 
## give lectures to in colleges in america i  




1387
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:10,720
## just finished doing 89 lectures in 12 states 
## okay i understand that just a few days ago  




1388
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:17,359
## you had a very uh strong recollection of the last 
## time you've been to a slaughterhouse yeah can you  




1389
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:22,799
## tell me about it in 2007 i actually went to an 
## auction house this is my first time i went to a  




1390
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:27,439
## place where the auction off animals i had been 
## to dozens of slaughterhouses over the years but  




1391
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:32,879
## i wanted to see this place it was open to the 
## public so i did not have to sneak around and  




1392
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:37,520
## break it at three in the morning so i walked 
## right in i had a camera with me i went backstage  




1393
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:44,080
## that day they were auctioning off sheep and cows 
## now first of all they had the males spray painted  




1394
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:50,960
## on their back blue to mark them and the females 
## pink the same markings that we've done to humans  




1395
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:57,520
## over the years with those atrocities which we can 
## talk about later what really was disturbing to me  




1396
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:01,041
## and saddening to me was the first 
## time the animals didn't recognize  




1397
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:05,840
## who i was and why i was there over the years 
## every time i went somewhere it was like they  




1398
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:10,399
## knew i was there for them and i'm like i'm getting 
## footage i'm going to show people what's going on  




1399
02:59:10,399 --> 02:59:16,319
## and i'm going to share this with the world well 
## this was the day that they were just terrified  




1400
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:21,519
## about what was going on and they turned their 
## backs to me and they were shaking and shivering  




1401
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:26,640
## and as they looked back it was like they were 
## saying what are you doing to me now where are  




1402
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:34,399
## you taking me now why are you stealing me away 
## from my family again leave me alone you two-legged  




1403
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:40,639
## devil just leave me alone and here i am going 
## wait no i i'm gonna help i'm just showing people  




1404
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:47,520
## what's going on and they didn't recognize me and 
## this is where my anger emanates from when people  




1405
02:59:48,319 --> 02:59:53,279
## don't want to listen to the message this is why 
## vegans get so militant because i don't want to be  




1406
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:59,120
## a two-legged devil to the animals or to anybody 
## i don't want to be vicious and mean and callous  




1407
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:06,080
## and vile but as a species we are so callous 
## towards the animals that's how they view us
