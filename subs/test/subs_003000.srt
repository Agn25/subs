## i don't think they're feeling any pain i just 
## keep going until the cows are oh i'm like yeah




251
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
## this is not an isolated incident




252
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,560
## don't for one minute think that this is an 
## isolated incident this is how slaves are treated  




253
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,880
## you don't really think that 
## slaves get treated nicely do you  




254
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
## you really think white people were nice when 
## they ship black people over here on ships  




255
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,400
## you don't think nazis were nice when they walk 
## jews and gypsies into the gas chambers do you  




256
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,680
## and this happens because you want to buy 
## those products yeah that guy's a scumbag  




257
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,520
## for doing that but he's doing that because 
## you want to eat what comes out of her body  




258
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,320
## and enough already you're not a caveman and 
## you're not a cave woman anymore stop acting  




259
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:29,200
## like neanderthals this is 2010 give 
## it up it's not cute and it's not funny  




260
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,320
## because animals are being abused it is not your 
## right it is not your freedom to do this to them  




261
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,960
## you don't get to have freedom when 
## somebody else doesn't that's a violation  




262
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,680
## and if you wonder why vegans get so upset 
## sometimes like i am right now you just  




263
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,400
## saw some of it every time we show up at a farm 
## somebody's punching chicken and stabbing somebody  




264
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,560
## and something else that i'm curious about how 
## come when i show videos like this of people  




265
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,600
## punching and kicking animals people are 
## more upset with that than when they shove  




266
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,440
## a knife in their throat so even if you find 
## a farm where they're not punching and kicking  




267
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,959
## when they shove a knife in their throat to put a 
## bullet between their eyes how is that not cruelty  




268
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,920
## did you know that 90 percent of hamburger 
## meat in america comes from the dairy industry  




269
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,359
## when cows no longer give huge amounts of milk 
## after three to seven years slaughterhouse no  




270
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:43,760
## exceptions if ever given a chance cows can live to 
## be 18 to 25 and cows are like all female mammals  




271
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,760
## i am not trying to talk down to you when i speak 
## about animal issues it's just that people don't  




272
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,600
## think that animals go through the same things 
## the same emotions that you go through that we  




273
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,720
## all go through in order for a female mammal 
## to give to give milk she has to be pregnant
