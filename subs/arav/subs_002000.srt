205
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,040
## something we can really like get into and kind of 
## debunk so one of the more common things that came  




206
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,120
## up with my questions that came up questions that 
## came up sorry topics that came up was about money  




207
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,000
## now we talked about the donor obviously but we 
## didn't talk about the general things that people  




208
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,840
## seem to be obsessing over when it comes 
## to av so these general money concerns as  




209
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
## i've called on my general money concerns they 
## include things like people are upset because  




210
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,360
## you guys didn't want to release financial records 
## they're upset because apparently that they don't  




211
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,120
## know or you have not released where donations go 
## um they're upset because they the the chapters  




212
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,360
## are claiming they receive no money um so so i know 
## you've dealt with some of this on your own channel  




213
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,120
## and i'm on your own videos and i guess you're sick 
## of talking about it but again my aim today is to  




214
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,960
## get into it and and to ask maybe more questions 
## that maybe people haven't you guys maybe haven't  




215
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,240
## had before and to get really some solid facts and 
## detail out here so that people can't continue to  




216
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
## discuss this randomly like you said i feel like we 
## need to vet these things rather than just taking  




217
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,880
## people's words um so what what is that situation 
## then so let's let's be more specific with the  




218
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,200
## question there's money coming in and obviously 
## there's money going out um people are claiming  




219
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,960
## that there's a problem that they don't know what's 
## coming in and where it's going so how how would  




220
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,720
## you respond to that like what what do you think 
## uh how can you reassure these people that it's  




221
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,840
## going where it should be or you know what the 
## situation is what the financial situation is  




222
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,840
## i think going back to what you were saying 
## before about like how it's the cool thing  




223
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,760
## now to hate on av it's also the cool thing 
## to just ask these questions because you don't  




224
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,400
## you don't see other organizations or other 
## activists being asked the same questions and the  




225
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,880
## people that are asking these questions and making 
## the same claims don't have any kind of evidence to  




226
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,840
## back up their claim so it's just because somebody 
## brought it up in the comment section and they saw  




227
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
## it they're just going to repeat it and then the 
## next person is going to say the same thing so  




228
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,400
## um like the fact that we have never 
## done any financial reports is actually  




229
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,160
## [ __ ] because it's not that we're not 
## willing to do it as that we haven't been  




230
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:35,680
## required to do it yet and if anyone is actually 
## interested all of this information is public so  




231
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,840
## they can just go and look it up and they 
## will have access to and they can see that  




232
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:49,440
## um we're required to do our first financial um 
## what is it called like reporting this year end  




233
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,840
## of the year or it's probably going to be delayed 
## next year actually because of coverage but  




234
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,360
## because we registered av as a non-for-profit 
## i think it was in 2018 the way it works here  




235
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,040
## you don't you're not asked to do a reporting for 
## like the first year or the first couple of years  




236
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:16,240
## so it's not that we because otherwise we wouldn't 
## be able to run av if we hadn't done our um legal  




237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,720
## requirements whatever it is that you know the 
## government is asking you to do as a not-for-profit  




238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,800
## it's not like you can just say no i'm not going 
## to do my reporting and then you can continue to  




239
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:34,400
## run av as a not-for-profit so um yeah like i said 
## these claims are just faceless there's no evidence  




240
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
## and also people have no reason to think that 
## the money is not going where we say it's going  




241
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,360
## if somebody has proof that the money is going 
## elsewhere then they need to come forward and  




242
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,560
## show us where the money is going um we have 
## explained this like you said multiple times  




243
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,200
## we have told people where the money is going 
## like with all these different categories so we  




244
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,960
## can just repeat that but i feel like these people 
## are committed to think a certain way and no matter  




245
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,960
## what you say they're just not gonna believe you so 
## yeah i i just don't know if there's anything else  




246
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,520
## that we can say to clarify this for people yeah 
## i i guess for the sake of for the sake of this um  




247
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,120
## for the sake of this stream i don't want i i don't 
## i'm not interested in going through literally like  




248
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
## i wouldn't expect you to do this to go through 
## like okay we spend this much here and this much  




249
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,400
## i don't want to do that that's just it's not you 
## don't owe that to people watching this i think  




250
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
## what i'm more interested in is like maybe you 
## could just list off like the things that i  




251
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,720
## don't know the biggest spending from av and like 
## where it goes to give people an idea because uh  




252
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,360
## maybe some people genuinely have no idea where 
## an organization like av would spend money let's  




253
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,720
## assume they're asking it out of you know interest 
## rather than out of accusation like if somebody  




254
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,320
## asked you hey i'm just curious like where would 
## it go like where do you spend the most money how  




255
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,840
## would you answer that question like just just to 
## appear appease them let's say or just to you know
