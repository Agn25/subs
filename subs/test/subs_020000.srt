02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:39,840
## so




927
02:00:49,520 --> 02:01:00,960
## i am forever embarrassed to be a human being to 
## stand upright like that's something to be proud of




928
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:09,200
## did you ever wonder why mcdonald's and burger 
## king and wendy's never use those images in  




929
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:20,240
## their tv ads no severed heads dismembered limbs 
## corpses blood guts always showing you a happy  




930
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:29,360
## singing smiling cartoon caricature 
## instead lying to you brainwashing you  




931
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,000
## and programming you not to care about 
## things you would normally care about  




932
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:45,520
## things that you used to care about when you were 
## young innocent and uncorrupted by society's lies  




933
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:52,160
## so how come if the animals in that video were 
## dogs and cats people would be outraged and if they  




934
02:01:52,160 --> 02:02:01,440
## were kids the world would scream bloody murder 
## instead the victims are cows and chickens and fish  




935
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:08,960
## and all of a sudden it's okay so i am a 
## little confused here is the slaughterhouse  




936
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:14,880
## the problem or is the problem just who's 
## getting killed in the slaughterhouse  




937
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:25,840
## because it's a house of slaughter why does it 
## even exist especially when peace begins at the  




938
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:32,480
## dinner table with what you put into your body on a 
## daily basis good people don't talk about kindness  




939
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:41,440
## they practice it and they certainly don't pray 
## about love on the weekends for an hour or two they  




940
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:47,760
## actually give it all the time i know you have 
## the capability of understanding right from wrong  




941
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:54,080
## because you all hate people who harm children why 
## not hate people who harm animals it's hypocritical  




942
02:02:54,080 --> 02:03:01,920
## why protect one victim and then violate and 
## ignore the other victim when neither victim wants  




943
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:12,560
## nor deserves the abuse they just wish it would end 
## stop praising the innocents in children and then  




944
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:19,520
## ignoring and making fun of the exact same 
## innocence in the animals and everyone has  




945
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,240
## to stop making these idiotic claims that 
## humans are the only ones who are capable  




946
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:30,560
## of being rational and aware and that animals 
## operate on instinct only can i explain something  




947
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:37,760
## everybody in a pretty simple way breathing 
## is instinctive everything else is a thought  




948
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:44,800
## attached to an action it's not an accident 
## that animals can build a home if given a chance  




949
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:51,680
## and return to that home but they can care for 
## their babies that they can find shade on a sunny  




950
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:59,840
## day or seek warmth when it's cold figure out when 
## to sleep or stay awake locate water to drink fly  




951
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:05,600
## in a bee formation hide when they don't want to 
## be seen defend their territories all these actions  




952
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:11,840
## prove beyond a reasonable doubt that animals 
## have the capacity of being rational and aware  




953
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:20,080
## the human animal is the only animal that spends 
## the majority of time not thinking eating at steak  




954
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:26,880
## and shake in the golden corral and applebee's 
## and long john silvers is not rational thought  




955
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:34,720
## but this isn't a competition of intelligence or 
## awareness this is about justice when we were kids  




956
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:39,840
## each and every single one of us when our parents 
## our grandparents sat us down and read us a story  




957
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:46,960
## that story was about animals and when that 
## story was read to us we smiled and giggled  




958
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:53,760
## uncontrollably we even mimicked the noises they 
## made their language we wanted to play with them  




959
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:59,040
## so badly not have someone shove a knife in 
## their throat and cut them up into pieces  




960
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:06,800
## what happened to you along the way who 
## stole your empathy and your conscience
