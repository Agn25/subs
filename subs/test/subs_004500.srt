00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,040
## with a bare hand or a long steel device to eject 
## them with bold sperm female mammals have to be  




359
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:14,080
## pregnant to produce and give milf mother cows then 
## have their babies stolen from them after birth  




360
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,680
## because once we eliminate the babies from the 
## equation we get to drink all that milk instead  




361
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,800
## and when mother cows can't produce huge amounts 
## of milk after three to seven years they get a  




362
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
## happy day at the slaughterhouse where if they're 
## really lucky they'll get turned into a happy meal  




363
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,400
## other companies love to lie about 
## happy animals too what about that  




364
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,840
## wish i wear an oscar meyer wiener jingle  




365
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,640
## that's pretty cute except for the fact that when 
## they're born male babies have their testicles  




366
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:56,560
## ripped out without anesthetic standard practice 
## the meat industry always controls procreation all  




367
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,640
## the female pigs get raped every year to impregnate 
## them just like the cows baby pigs then have most  




368
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,280
## of their teeth cut off right down the gum line 
## and their tails cut off too all without anesthetic  




369
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,880
## to try and reduce flesh damage from fighting and 
## biting each other in their overcrowding conditions  




370
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,240
## and when pigs reach 300 pounds in six 
## months thanks to genetic modification  




371
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,640
## they get a happy day at the slaughterhouse too 
## where they get chopped up into a thousand pieces  




372
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,600
## the egg industry though man they just might 
## possess the greatest marketing propaganda of  




373
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,480
## all time because they've actually convinced 
## you to eat something that came out of a hens  




374
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:50,640
## all inclusive all in one ass vagina and 
## the backside of a bird is called a cloaca  




375
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,960
## it is one hole where the poop the p the vaginal 
## fluid and scrambled eggs and omelets come from  




376
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,720
## hate to be the bearer of more bad news 
## but mommy and daddy lied to us too  




377
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:14,720
## we're not that special and we're not perfect just 
## the way we are but at least when you become vegan  




378
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,440
## you are trying trying to reduce and eliminate 
## gratuitous amounts of cruelty and violence  




379
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:30,720
## which is all i'm asking of you today so how 
## come when one human dies it's a tragedy but when  




380
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:38,000
## billions of animals are killed with premeditation 
## it's a celebration and what's really odd about  




381
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,080
## this tragedy celebration dichotomy is that 
## besides some kind of a self-defense situation  




382
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,840
## everyone knows that killing is evil and 
## wrong because every time a bear kills a hiker  




383
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:59,360
## what do we do start saving hakuna matata praise 
## the hiker for being part of the circle of life  




384
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:11,040
## tell his family well he just wasn't fit enough to 
## survive [ __ ] we scream bloody murder label that  




385
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,920
## bear a homicidal maniac and get a bunch of people 
## with guns and go kill that bear for killing the  




386
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,360
## hiker funny how the circle of life never comes 
## into play when we're getting killed and that's  




387
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:31,120
## because the circle of life ain't nothing but an 
## aggrandized arbitrary [ __ ] excuse to torment  




388
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:38,640
## and kill somebody else with impunity it's a cute 
## story it really is written directed and produced  




389
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:50,400
## by us the killers the dictators the victimizers 
## the victims in this psychotic scenario are not  




390
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,360
## willing participants as you clearly saw on 
## that opening video but here's something even  




391
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,280
## more interesting than that sometimes even 
## the killers question their own behavior  




392
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,760
## kindness is a choice so is violence spare 
## me the animals can't think or rationalize  




393
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,160
## because they operate on instinct only nonsense 
## because if you go to my website at dap.org check  




394
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,960
## out the animal intelligence essay and click 
## the link that says leopard saves a baby baboon  




395
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,840
## and watch a big carnivorous cat have 
## second thoughts about the circle of life  




396
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:36,080
## she kills a baboon but doesn't realize the 
## baboon is a mother with a newborn baby so she  




397
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:42,880
## intentionally lets a skulking hyena have the dead 
## mother's corpse to chomp on while she gently picks  




398
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,320
## up the baby puts the baby in a tree and stays 
## in the tree to protect the baby from the hyena  




399
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,960
## if the circle of life was genuine and 
## animals couldn't think that leopard would  




400
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,520
## have instinctively instantly killed that baby 
## instead she chose to comfort him to protect him
