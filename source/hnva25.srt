1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
the outreach workshop that 
i'm doing for you guys is  

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,200
relevant to the cube of truth we 
are going to start right at the top  

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,880
so the first part of this workshop is about 
veganism because we have to get clear about what  

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,920
veganism actually means before we start talking 
about how to do outreach veganism if you ask a  

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,800
group of people what it means you'll get multiple 
versions of what they believe it to be you  

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
probably had this experience just by interacting 
with vegans you'll find that the definition that  

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,040
they hold dear to them is quite different for 
everybody veganism has nothing to do with our  

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,400
health it has nothing to do with the environment 
it has nothing to do with human rights it has  

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,920
nothing to do with our affection towards animals 
it is only about justice for non-human animals  

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,520
as far as it pertains to humans inflicting 
harm exploitation suffering etc upon non-human  

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
animals so this is about addressing non-human 
animal exploitation at the hands of humans

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
in essence to summarize vegan 
equals anti-animal abuse

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,600
activism what does it mean in essence what 
it means is speaking up for the victims in  

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,120
the same way that you would want to be 
spoken for if you were in their position  

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,280
it is being a medium of truth and enacting change 
by prioritizing the victims and not the oppressors

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
i recently made a post on social media 
and the caption for that post summarizes  

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400
in essence what we do on the streets 
and why we focus on what we focus on  

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,000
animal agriculture doesn't start with corporations 
it doesn't start with the government it doesn't  

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,440
even start with farms it starts with you it starts 
with the consumer the consumers who demand the  

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,400
products and there's many different ways that 
you can create demand for animal exploitation  

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,000
you may not necessarily purchase it may be given 
to you you may be wearing secondhand leather  

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,880
somebody might pay for your ticket to go to a zoo 
there's many other circumstances i could point out  

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,960
but you are creating demand and you're promoting 
that this culture of animal exploitation within  

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,240
humans is okay it's acceptable and that's 
what i mean by starting with us with humans  

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:46,960
and what we do on the streets is we focus on the 
demand we start from where it starts and it's not  

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,880
to say that it isn't important to work in the 
political sphere to end things like government  

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,840
subsidies for animal agriculture that is a worthy 
fight and i would like to see that succeed i would  

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,960
also like to see more of the direct action 
stuff that holds the corporations accountable  

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,720
but what we also really need is to start from 
where it starts which is the consumer demand so  

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,400
that's why we do what we do always remember 
that you will never have 100 success rate  

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
in animal rights outreach there is no magic 
set of words to use during outreach that  

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
will make someone go vegan if they're ready 
they'll listen if they're not ready they won't  

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,000
this is a very important point for you guys 
to understand because you might get down on  

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
yourself if you don't get through to somebody and 
you may think that you've said everything correct  

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,680
and you may have said it all correctly but at the 
end of the day it comes down to the individual  

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,040
whether they're willing and open to change 
and take action with the context provided your  

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
function as an activist is to hold the individual 
you're speaking with accountable for the animal  

38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,400
abuse that they are responsible for and make 
them aware of the consequences of their choices

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
your goal as an activist on the streets doing 
outreach at the cubes is not to plant seeds  

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:20,560
animal rights outreach is not verbal leafleting 
what we mean by that is you're not just riffing  

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,720
off information and factoids to people you're not 
literally a brochure in human form you're not just  

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,160
telling people about how old chickens are when 
they die how many chickens are killed you know  

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,240
etc um the whole point is you're actually 
interacting with somebody and you know there  

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,120
are certain facts and information that need to be 
used at certain points throughout the interaction  

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,640
but for the most part most people prefer things to 
be kept simple you might have heard the expression  

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,400
kiss keep it simple stupid it really does 
apply to the majority of the public especially  

47
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
when you're on the streets and people stop at 
a cube you know they're not usually looking  

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,000
for something that's too deep when they interact 
with you most people in terms of digesting this  

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,720
information will prefer for you to keep it simple 
and keep the statistics and the facts to a minimum

50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,280
if the goal were to provide information we would 
hand out leaflets and magazines and brochures the  

51
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,760
function of outreach is to make people understand 
the consequences of their choices by holding them  

52
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,760
accountable and centering the interaction about 
what they can personally do about animal abuse  

53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:49,360
on an individual level most people you speak with 
will try to deflect from accountability and palm  

54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,760
this off to governments or corporations and say 
that they need to change or they might even start  

55
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,520
talking about other human beings and say how are 
you going to get the whole world to become vegan  

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,320
though these kinds of distractions that they 
bring up are all to deflect from accountability  

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,000
individual accountability so it's your job as 
an activist to bring it back to the individual  

58
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,120
veganism is not about love or 
compassion you can dislike animals

59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,280
and you are still obligated to be vegan 
in the same way that it applies to humans  

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
you can hate people but you don't have the 
right to enslave torture and murder them  

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,920
veganism is about justice your likability 
does not determine your rights so outreach  

62
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,120
is not about how you or anyone else feels 
about animals necessarily if you don't go  

63
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,200
around beating children you aren't 
instantly a compassionate individual  

64
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
if you don't go around abusing animals on the 
streets you're not necessarily a compassionate  

65
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,440
person refraining from injustice does not make you 
compassionate by default veganism is a non-action  

66
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,200
therefore it's not loving it's merely the right 
thing to do the same and rational thing to do

67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
this approach that i'm teaching you is about pure 
honesty telling someone the truth is the most  

68
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,040
respectful thing that you can do for them when you 
agree with every statement said by the bystander  

69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,400
they will often lose respect for you and 
you will lose control of the conversation  

70
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
when you do this they see that your desire 
to be validated by them is stronger than  

71
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
your desire to end animal cruelty and the 
whole reason why you're standing out on the  

72
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,640
streets trying to engage with the public 
thereby making a mockery of animal rights  

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,360
can you imagine if the primary goal of human 
rights activists was to be liked by the oppressors  

74
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,280
in any other context this would be insane

75
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,520
you may be hesitant to speak boldly whenever you 
are afraid to speak up for the animals directly  

76
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,320
or if bystanders call you too extreme 
place yourself in the victims position  

77
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,880
and analyze your approach from their perspective 
could you look a cow in the eyes and say i'm doing  

78
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,400
my best on your behalf i'm speaking for you as 
if i was in your position would you consider a  

79
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,880
respectful yet direct conversation too extreme if 
you were locked up in a slaughterhouse right now

80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,640
don't talk about health and environment this 
is obviously a huge thing in the animal rights  

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,720
movement vegans so often talk about human 
health and the environment with an aim  

82
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,760
to hook people in to becoming vegan and we 
tell ourselves it doesn't matter how we get  

83
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,080
people to go vegan just as long as they go 
vegan the problem with this idea is that  

84
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
more often than not it's a myth that these 
people actually go vegan and if they do  

85
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,200
become plant-based what they end up doing is 
becoming the worst kind of candidate for a vegan  

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,520
because they are the type of vegans 
to rub veganism through the mud on  

87
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:43,840
the basis of doing it for their health or for 
the environment both of which are human-centric  

88
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,240
it's still a selfish message that you're 
promoting which is completely beside the point  

89
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,280
and not the basis for veganism the whole point 
of veganism is altruism doing something for  

90
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
non-human animals non-human animals deserve 
to have a cause dedicated to them and so  

91
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,360
when we promote animal rights it should be about 
animal rights why do we think people care about  

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,280
either their health or the environment most people 
in the streets do not care about their health  

93
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,880
nor the environment so rooting out outreach 
in these topics will marginalize the animals  

94
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,280
health and environment have become exacerbated 
because people do not take animal abuse  

95
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,120
seriously trying to hook people with an approach 
that revolves around what benefits them does a  

96
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,960
disservice to the animals so focus on the 
root cause of the issue the animal abuse  

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,840
whenever people talk about how badly our 
environment is affected by animal agriculture  

98
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,800
whether it's someone who is vegan or non-vegan 
talking about these points and by the way  

99
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,640
most non-vegans already know about how bad 
animal agriculture is for the environment why  

100
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,600
do they know about this there are so many victims 
involved in this injustice that it does in fact  

101
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,720
impact the environment so the root cause of this 
issue is animal abuse and so it makes no sense to  

102
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,160
talk about the symptom and to make this again 
a selfish message for humans to benefit from

103
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,960
why don't people care about ethics

104
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
because vegans don't advocate 
for animals correctly  

105
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,600
they focus on things like plant-based recipes 
restaurants weight loss or deforestation another  

106
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,920
reason is they lead with phrases like friends 
not food or animal lovers don't eat animals  

107
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,320
this is not a conversation about sympathy 
this is a conversation about accountability  

108
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,720
don't plead with bystanders make them 
understand the consequences of their choices  

109
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,360
by placing them in the victim's position morality 
when it comes to this injustice and injustice in  

110
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,840
general you can say but especially when it 
comes to this injustice is black and white  

111
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
if bystanders tell you that you aren't 
considering the other side to this or that you  

112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,640
aren't open-minded enough that is a distraction 
there is no other side to needless animal abuse  

113
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,920
you either support it or you don't don't get lost 
in these distractions compare animal abuse to a  

114
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,720
comparable injustice and get it back on track when 
you're comparing animal abuse to another injustice  

115
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,400
we've found that the best thing to do is to 
compare it to them put the bystander in that  

116
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,640
cow's position how would you feel your babies 
were being stolen from you after you were raped  

117
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,360
and you had your neck sliced open what i found 
is that most people mostly care about themselves  

118
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,920
you know they're not really going to understand 
unless they imagine for themselves what it would  

119
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,800
be like if they were in that position if we want 
them to connect to what animals are going through  

120
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,440
which injustice should you compare to i just 
touched on this a little bit but we'll get  

121
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,360
further into it it is most effective to compare 
the to injustices such as child abuse or human  

122
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,320
trafficking but even better the most effective is 
to place the bystander in the victim's position  

123
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,960
avoid dog comparisons this goes back to not 
leading with compassion it's not about the  

124
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,560
love that people feel towards animals it's about 
the hate that they feel towards injustice i can't  

125
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,360
tell you how many times i've personally learned 
this lesson about using dogs as a comparison  

126
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,200
and people will say yeah well if i was in china i 
would eat dogs here's the thing most people don't  

127
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,360
view dogs truly as individuals one indication of 
that in our society is that we have dog shelters  

128
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,320
that kill dogs by the thousand and so again 
most people mostly only care about themselves  

129
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,720
it doesn't come down to whether you can 
imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse  

130
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
it comes down to whether you can 
imagine yourself in a slaughterhouse  

131
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,400
statistics keep them minimal outside of what is 
asked of you state minimal information during  

132
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,400
outreach conversations we are not on the streets 
to verbally leaflet let the footage provide the  

133
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,920
context to the conversation you aren't at a cube 
of truth to be a statistician you're there to  

134
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,760
have a concise conversation that holds people 
to account for their unjustified animal abuse  

135
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,600
a conversation will go on for longer than 
necessary if it turns into an argument over  

136
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,760
statistics and it's not to say that we can't 
win these debates we can we have logic and facts  

137
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,320
reason but what they're usually doing is they're 
trying to deflect from accountability they're  

138
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,840
trying to distract the conversation 
so that they don't have to take action  

139
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,080
so you have to understand that before 
you entertain any of those points this  

140
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,520
is another reason why you shouldn't bring 
up health and environment talking points  

141
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
and this is something i've learned time and time 
again when i do bring up health and environment  

142
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,160
if i entertain those points and i know that 
sometimes it can be tempting super tempting  

143
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,600
you will end up debating how much iron you 
get as a vegan or whatever the case may be  

144
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
all of it is just a distraction to 
what really needs to be discussed

145
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
not everybody on the streets is worth talking to 
part of your role is to assess who is reachable  

146
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,680
and who is not many people are not reachable this 
is a numbers game i've had cubes where i've had  

147
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,200
zero people take the issue seriously over the 
course of three or four hours as part for the  

148
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,280
course i've had cubes where almost every person 
i spoke to was open and willing and they got it  

149
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,640
plenty of those people that are open and worth 
talking to are out there i also will say that  

150
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,640
even if somebody doesn't get it and you've 
said the correct thing on behalf of the animals  

151
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,920
it is still worthwhile because you 
never know what kind of an effect  

152
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,840
what you've said will have 
on that person's subconscious

153
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
and you never know how that may come up again 
within them in future if they want to have a  

154
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,600
short conversation with you keep it short with 
them don't entertain bystanders who want to engage  

155
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,920
in long argumentative debates do not underestimate 
the cunningness of non-vegan guilt and the ability  

156
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,160
that many non-vegans will have to waste your vital 
time at work for the animals if people don't take  

157
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:12,560
this issue seriously expect that they will want 
to waste your time they may even seem sincere  

158
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,360
and nice they may seem like very sweet people but 
if they don't take this issue seriously they may  

159
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:27,360
just take you for a ride and waste your time when 
people feel guilty and most people you speak with  

160
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,840
by and large will feel guilty 
when their guilt flares up  

161
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,960
they will have all of these mechanisms that come 
up to protect themselves or to defend themselves  

162
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,880
and to justify their guilt and that's what 
we mean by the cunningness of non-vegan guilt  

163
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
you shouldn't underestimate it you should 
understand that it's a very real thing  

164
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,960
and it will cause humans to behave in 
very irrational ways i've never seen  

165
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,360
people act more irrationally that i have with 
non-vegans when we address this issue with them

166
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:14,960
so again activism is not sales sales training does 
not equal good activism using slick talk to trick  

167
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,840
people into veganism does not work your job is 
to hold the bystander accountable it's up to  

168
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,880
them which actions they take initially av made too 
strong of a connection between sales and activism  

169
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,360
tools taught in sales training only go so far 
so this is why i'm making such a strong point  

170
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,120
about the sales stuff it's because back in 2016 
when we put together the model for the cube of  

171
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,360
truth and the outreach element to the cube i did 
actually make too strong of a connection between  

172
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,400
sales and activism so this was back in 2016 that 
i did this and i essentially called what i was  

173
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,360
bringing to the table a value-based sales approach 
and when i said a value-based sales approach i was  

174
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,680
intending on differentiating from the 
general regular form of sales that people  

175
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,320
are commonly used to value based meaning 
there is no money involved here however  

176
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,080
what this did is it created this idea that if 
you have 10 20 30 40 50 years of sales experience  

177
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,000
that you're automatically experienced as an 
activist and that's just not how this works at all  

178
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,720
in fact what i've found is and i've personally 
done sales for well over 10 years is a lot of what  

179
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,920
i learned is not actually applicable most of what 
i learned is not applicable in activism whatsoever  

180
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,840
in fact a lot of the little tools that we did 
bring over into activism we no longer really use  

181
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,440
it's just good to understand how certain aspects 
of sales work i just shared one thing with you  

182
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
guys which is kiss keep it simple stupid i'm 
not even sure if that belongs to the sales world  

183
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,080
but that's where i learned it and it 
applies to almost everything in life  

184
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:19,280
and in essence at its very basis sales applies 
to life you know if you have children and they  

185
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:26,160
love to eat confectionery every day for every 
meal convincing them to eat a carrot is sales  

186
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,320
i'm convincing you right now to take this 
approach seriously and to follow this protocol  

187
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:40,800
while you're at cubes of truth but my point is 
that it can get blown out of proportion and like  

188
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,760
i said it doesn't necessarily mean everything that 
you've learned in sales is applicable in activism  

189
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,480
a successful conversation is not one where the 
bystander says i'm going vegan it's where you say  

190
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,200
the right things this is really important 
again like i was saying before some people  

191
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,120
may not seem open and willing they may not 
give you the answer that you're looking for  

192
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,120
when people say i'm going vegan that's obviously a 
good indication but they may not be they may just  

193
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,280
be excited in the moment they may not be genuine 
about that the best way to measure whether you've  

194
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,120
had a good interaction is to look at what 
you've said have you said the correct thing  

195
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,000
on behalf of the animals or not if you have 
you've done the best that you can possibly do  

196
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,360
most people become vegan after they hear the truth 
from us how long it takes is up to the individual  

197
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,840
the socratic method just by show of hands how 
many of you don't know about the socratic method

198
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,240
okay there's a few of you so socratic method 
it's named after socrates and essentially what he  

199
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,560
taught was when you're in a debate with somebody 
and this is more of a debate tactic so that's  

200
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,280
why it's not applicable in its entirety to an 
outreach conversation because the whole thing  

201
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,080
isn't necessarily a debate the whole thing is 
an interaction that will involve some parts of  

202
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,680
it being a debate and so what he taught was 
instead of framing something as a statement  

203
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,280
in this context for example animal cruelty is 
wrong right that's a statement the better way to  

204
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,240
frame it is as a question what do you think about 
animal cruelty do you think that animal cruelty  

205
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,600
is wrong or how do you feel about animal cruelty 
so one of those variations was a closed question  

206
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,280
and two of them was an open-ended question we'll 
get into the open-ended questions in this slide  

207
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,880
so credit questioning is a communication tool 
that we use within our approach it is not an  

208
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,040
approach in and of itself where we ask questions 
to lead the bystander to their own conclusions  

209
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,680
use open-ended questions such as why are you 
against animal abuse instead of a closed statement  

210
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:12,480
such as animal abuse is wrong open-ended questions 
are generally preferred to anchor and progress the  

211
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,680
conversation you should use closed-ended 
questions and statements also but usually  

212
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,960
an open-ended question does a better 
job sometimes you just need to seal  

213
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,720
off and confirm an aspect of what it is that 
you're discussing at that particular moment  

214
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,560
and that's where the closed-ended questions are 
important okay this is important you versus we  

215
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,800
we don't torture and kill animals for products 
non-vegans do using we undermines individual  

216
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,800
accountability this has been a personal lesson for 
me and something that we've all learned within av  

217
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,840
for quite some time now but essentially what we 
do as activists is we find ourselves saying we  

218
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,520
we with non-vegans all the time why do we do this 
to animals you know we grow up i know that we're  

219
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,160
trying to relate to non-vegans but it does take 
away from individual accountability and people do  

220
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,400
need to understand the clear difference between 
veganism and non-veganism and they will not see  

221
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,280
and understand that difference clearly enough 
if you keep using language that isn't accurately  

222
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,800
describing the issue if you keep saying we you're 
not actually being accurate so be careful about  

223
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,880
what it is you're saying when you tell non-vegans 
that we as a society are responsible for animal  

224
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,520
cruelty in farms it takes away the imperative 
for individual accountability it makes them  

225
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,080
think of lobbying or government programs instead 
of personal responsibilities people need to feel  

226
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,920
guilty to change they'll only change once they 
understand that there is a difference between you  

227
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:06,960
the vegan and them the non-vegan i understand that 
that last slide might seem like we are creating  

228
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,440
division between us and individuals it's not about 
being deliberately combative and creating division  

229
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,320
with people it's again just about making sure that 
they understand clearly that there is a massive  

230
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,880
difference between veganism and non-veganism 
and i think you all already know this because  

231
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,280
otherwise you wouldn't be vegan and you wouldn't 
stay vegan and you understand that there is a  

232
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,040
big difference between what you're doing now and 
going back to being non-vegan a huge difference  

233
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,960
and that's why we should really be careful 
about the language we use okay why versus how  

234
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,880
people already know how to go vegan it's really 
simple stuff with the constant availability of  

235
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,240
google and the internet anybody can figure out 
how to become vegan instantly in order for people  

236
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,920
to feel the need to become vegan they need to 
be held accountable for why they should do it  

237
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:15,360
with any other injustice you would never focus 
on how by talking about how to not participate  

238
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:23,040
in the violence focusing on the how in the context 
of any other injustice would be an insult to the  

239
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,880
victims and the entire movement fighting to 
end their oppression part of me it's not to  

240
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,760
say that how is not an important talking point we 
should give people that but it's only at the very  

241
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,480
end once we have sufficiently and emphatically 
address the why factor you know we give people  

242
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,040
a card as you know at the end we always arm 
people with the resources and the how factor  

243
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:54,640
all you really need as a compass to be vegan is 
is what i'm doing right now vegan or not does this  

244
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,080
restaurant have vegan meals is this product vegan 
is this ingredient vegan is going to zoos vegan  

245
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,840
okay so it's really simple really really simple 
stuff and i think that you should be aware of  

246
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,440
whether you're coddling people into this or 
not and babying people into this is a problem  

247
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
it shows weakness in the actual 
message if you're doing that  

248
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,200
vegetarianism is cancer to animal rights i'm not 
just saying this for shock value i truly mean this  

249
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,240
the longer the vegetarianism and veganism 
get conflated the longer it will take  

250
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,760
for us to get the message out there that 
veganism is about non-human animal rights  

251
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
and that that is a serious injustice that 
people need to take very very seriously  

252
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,840
vegetarians are non-vegans and should be 
outreached in the same manner as anyone else  

253
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,000
and in most cases even harder vegetarians are our 
target market they're no different to paleo eaters  

254
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,600
people who eat a paleo diet why should we treat 
them any differently so as you may know people who  

255
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,120
eat a paleo diet do not eat dairy and we as vegans 
i use this point a lot and i hear other vegans  

256
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,040
using this point a lot we talk about how the 
dairy industry is quite possibly the cruelest  

257
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,800
industry at least for land animals on earth 
paleo eaters don't consume any dairy products

258
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840
why are they any different to 
vegetarians vegetarians don't consume  

259
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:50,800
flesh while flesh is an obvious form of cruelty 
we know as vegans that dairy is no different  

260
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,680
and that what happens on dairy farms and in 
slaughterhouses to the cows and their babies  

261
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,440
is nothing short of an atrocity of a holocaust 
and is no different to what happens to animals  

262
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,600
in the meat industry arguably it's worse than 
the dairy industry and so as you can imagine it  

263
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,920
would be insane for us to call paleo people our 
allies to put them in the same bracket as vegans  

264
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,800
so why are we doing this with vegetarians it 
makes absolutely no sense it's counterproductive  

265
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,680
and it absolutely will marginalize the 
seriousness of this injustice the longer  

266
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,440
that we make vegetarians feel like they are animal 
people like they are defenders of animals like  

267
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,680
they are on the side of animal rights they need 
to be held to account just like everybody else

268
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,600
okay so they are not allies don't let other vegans 
or non-vegans manipulate you into thinking that  

269
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,280
they are so when you start the conversation you 
could say would you like to know why we're here  

270
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,560
what's up guys how you doing man i'm doing really 
well you wanna hear what we're doing oh sure  

271
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,920
cool and with the context of the footage playing 
tell them what the cube of truth sets out to do  

272
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,560
what we are here doing is showing the reality 
of what happens to animals in the meat dairy and  

273
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,280
egg industries and also other industries 
that exploit animals everything you see  

274
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,440
here is standard practice here and around the 
world what we're showing on these screens is  

275
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,000
the standard practice for what happens in the meat 
industry in this country but also around the world

276
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,320
these are the farms and the slaughterhouses 
that label themselves free range grass fed  

277
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,280
cage free organic ask the following open-ended 
question what are your feelings on animal abuse  

278
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,080
then confirm their stance to form moral 
consistency with something like so is it  

279
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,400
safe to say that you are against animal 
abuse how does the footage make you feel

280
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,600
it makes you feel bad are you both against animal 
abuse yes by the way most people will say yes  

281
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,560
it's very rare that you'll get 
anybody that says no to that question  

282
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
ask them do you think it's possible to be 
against animal abuse while demanding products  

283
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,880
like meat dairy and eggs do you think 
it's possible to be against animal abuse  

284
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,960
while eating meat dairy or eggs and this is where 
the truth starts to set in and most people say  

285
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,920
that's a really good question or their objections 
start to come out ask them what is stopping them  

286
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,760
from not abusing animals and becoming vegan what 
do you feel like would be stopping you and this  

287
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,320
is important that you say what do you feel like 
would be stopping you not what is stopping you  

288
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,560
because there as you know nothing there is nothing 
stopping anybody from going vegan really if you  

289
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,520
live in a modern society what do you feel like 
would be stopping you from not abusing animals  

290
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,320
and being vegan it's also important 
that you mention not abusing animals  

291
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,200
and being vegan and not just saying what do you 
feel like would be stopping you from being vegan  

292
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,440
what do you feel like for you two as individuals 
what do you feel like is holding you back from  

293
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,080
not being responsible for any of this animal 
abuse and living vegan it's much more powerful  

294
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,960
to add in the fact that you're not abusing 
animals when you're not vegan this will lead  

295
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,840
to their objections objection handling whenever 
a bystander brings up an objection place them  

296
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,520
in the victim's position and allow them to 
analyze the objection from that perspective  

297
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,280
every single time this happens the objection 
will fall apart you know as long as they're being  

298
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,080
genuine they're not being disingenuous 
intellectually no matter what the objection is  

299
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,080
it always crumbles i'm still gonna make meat but 
i'm gonna try and do it as humane as i can imagine  

300
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:01,680
yourself in the animal's position how do i murder 
you humanely is there a humane way for him to be  

301
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:09,840
murdered i'm asking you now just so you can help 
out maybe there isn't is there why do you say that

302
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,520
yeah he's not consenting to being killed is he 
he's not saying yes i'm okay with being killed you  

303
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,560
wouldn't say that would you most objections are 
easy and quick to respond to some are more nuanced  

304
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,720
and require a deeper explanation but they should 
still be quick to respond to your response should  

305
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:42,640
always anchor back to individual accountability 
it should always end up with the bystander you're  

306
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,880
speaking with being in the hot seat if it doesn't 
end up with that bystander being in the hot seat  

307
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
you aren't anchoring that point that you've 
just made correctly it has to always end there

308
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,160
bring it back to the individual if they try to 
create excuses that try to remove accountability  

309
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:10,720
for example pointing to rural communities 
lions low income families etc don't get lost  

310
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,440
in lengthy explanations again these things are 
distractions bring it back to the individual  

311
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,760
by placing themselves in the victim's position and 
asking how that excuse justifies their personal  

312
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,480
responsibility to animal abuse i need to 
update these slides to be completely honest  

313
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,120
contribution and support aren't 
the correct words to use here  

314
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,160
people aren't merely contributing to the animal 
holocaust they're literally responsible for it  

315
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,240
i'm going to give you an example if 
a hunter's wife is at home and before  

316
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,760
the hunter goes out to have a day of hunting 
the wife says have a great day hunting honey  

317
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,720
she's supporting hunting but she's not 
actually shooting the animals herself

318
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,160
non-vegans aren't merely doing that non-vegans 
are quite literally responsible for the shooting  

319
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,160
for the enslavement for the torture and the 
murder so contribution and support are not  

320
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,880
accurate words to be using here responsibility 
is the word to replace those words in all cases

321
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,880
tie in the benefit tie into benefit 
only once they concede by saying  

322
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,520
if they're against animal abuse 
then it's not possible to be against  

323
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,280
animal abuse while being responsible for 
it the number one benefit for being vegan  

324
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,160
the benefit is that they no longer have 
to be tortured and abused because of you  

325
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,400
in other words you no longer have to be the reason 
that animals suffer in the worst unimaginable ways  

326
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,240
for you as an individual if you say 
that you're against animal abuse  

327
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,880
and what you see on the screens then when you're 
vegan you no longer have to be a hypocrite

328
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,200
now this is the part of the 
interaction where things get very real  

329
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,040
and where the person understands that you're not 
just having a wishy-washy you're not just verbally  

330
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,560
leafleting you're not just saying what vegans 
tend to say you're having a real conversation  

331
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,160
about a real issue here and you're calling 
them out but you're not doing it because you  

332
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,200
are trying to be an [ __ ] you also should 
understand that telling somebody the truth is  

333
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,160
the most compassionate thing that you can do it's 
the most kind and loving thing that you can do  

334
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,800
sometimes the truth can be harsh and can 
sound brutal but you have to understand  

335
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,840
that that's just the nature of truth the 
truth is not always a bowl of cherries  

336
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,480
and when you're a medium of truth you have 
to accept that as part of your responsibility  

337
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,240
when you're spreading the truth you have to 
be comfortable with the fact that sometimes  

338
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,440
it will sound brutal but you're not saying 
it from a malicious place your intention  

339
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,120
is to end animal abuse and to change the actions 
of humans so that they are no longer responsible  

340
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,720
for it in a way it's liberating for the human as 
well as the animal who they are responsible for  

341
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,480
oppressing so do you know what the number one 
benefit is for being vegan can you take a guess

342
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,280
yeah what do you think it is that as well yeah 
yeah maybe it will help um like the industry  

343
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,800
to not like produce as much yeah because you're 
no longer demanding yeah and they are supplying  

344
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,800
demand that's basic economics you're one less 
person who's demanding it yeah let me put it  

345
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
to you this way also the number one benefit for 
the animals is that they're no longer tormented  

346
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,840
abused and harmed in any way because of you 
you're no longer the reason that animals  

347
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,040
suffer immensely are tormented and murdered 
the benefit for you as individuals also  

348
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
is that when you say you're against animal 
abuse you'll no longer be hypocrites  

349
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,600
do you disagree with that does that does that 
sound fair to you does that make sense to you  

350
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,560
yeah this drives home the accountability and makes 
them understand the consequences of their choices  

351
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,880
so this is where you close the conversation always 
end every outreach conversation by asking what the  

352
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,400
individual will be personally doing to 
take action ask the open-ended question  

353
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,840
after our conversation what are you 
going to do about this injustice  

354
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,880
after a long conversation they may they may 
still say that they'll only reduce or do nothing  

355
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,720
or they may say something like i'll try to do 
better if you can sense that the interaction will  

356
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,200
keep going in circles end the conversation with 
the statement but with people who say i'm going  

357
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,520
to try to do better or i'll reduce how much meat i 
eat they are still not getting how serious this is  

358
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,360
do you deem this to be an injustice 
and usually they will say yes i do  

359
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:35,040
and then i say would you take the stance that you 
just took with any other injustice you know if we  

360
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,600
were talking about yourself as the victim in this 
injustice would you find it acceptable for your  

361
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:48,560
oppressor to say that they are going to try to 
stop oppressing you or would you only deem it  

362
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,720
acceptable for them to stop immediately so 
what do you think you'll do about this then

363
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,760
eat less medium yeah maybe even stop eventually  

364
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,600
okay now is what you're seeing on the screens 
is animal abuse and injustice to each of you  

365
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,240
yes yes yeah okay would you take the position 
that you just took with any other injustice

366
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,720
let's say you're the victims in this scenario 
would you find it acceptable for your oppressor  

367
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,480
to try to harm you less and to do less harming 
of you or would you want them to stop entirely

368
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,840
immediately so please don't compromise 
when it comes to these non-human animals  

369
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,320
because they suffer just like you would if you 
were in their position again they may not like  

370
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,000
the sound of that um that it may not be what they 
want to hear because essentially what they're  

371
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,120
doing when they say i'm going to try or reduce 
is they're pandering to you because they want  

372
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,760
to tell you what you want to hear they can see 
that they're in they're on the wrong side of this  

373
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,040
that's why they're saying these things to 
you to end the conversation you you become a  

374
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,720
mirror at that point for the ugliness that they 
represent and when you say that their stance is  

375
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,840
not acceptable regardless of what they say after 
that you've put the needle where it needs to be

376
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,000
an effective statement in this situation can be 
and this is the last line that we always give  

377
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,120
people we tend to leave them with this so keep in 
mind that for however long that you're not vegan  

378
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,360
animals will be abused and tortured because of you 
so when you're ready to stop abusing animals and  

379
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,280
align your actions with your words you know what 
to do think about what side of history you want to  

380
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,240
stand on what i'd leave you guys with is just keep 
in mind that for however long you're not vegan  

381
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,120
unfortunately you guys are going to be 
responsible for what's taking place on  

382
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,160
the screen this animal abuse so just think 
about and decide what side of history you  

383
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:12,000
guys want to stand on when it comes to stamping 
out this injustice and that's the workshop guys
