00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
## the outreach workshop that 
## i'm doing for you guys is  




2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,200
## relevant to the cube of truth we 
## are going to start right at the top  




3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,880
## so the first part of this workshop is about 
## veganism because we have to get clear about what  




4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,920
## veganism actually means before we start talking 
## about how to do outreach veganism if you ask a  




5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,800
## group of people what it means you'll get multiple 
## versions of what they believe it to be you  




6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
## probably had this experience just by interacting 
## with vegans you'll find that the definition that  




7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,040
## they hold dear to them is quite different for 
## everybody veganism has nothing to do with our  




8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,400
## health it has nothing to do with the environment 
## it has nothing to do with human rights it has  




9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,920
## nothing to do with our affection towards animals 
## it is only about justice for non-human animals  




10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,520
## as far as it pertains to humans inflicting 
## harm exploitation suffering etc upon non-human  




11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
## animals so this is about addressing non-human 
## animal exploitation at the hands of humans




12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
## in essence to summarize vegan 
## equals anti-animal abuse




13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,600
## activism what does it mean in essence what 
## it means is speaking up for the victims in  




14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,120
## the same way that you would want to be 
## spoken for if you were in their position  




15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,280
## it is being a medium of truth and enacting change 
## by prioritizing the victims and not the oppressors




16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
## i recently made a post on social media 
## and the caption for that post summarizes  




17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400
## in essence what we do on the streets 
## and why we focus on what we focus on  




18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,000
## animal agriculture doesn't start with corporations 
## it doesn't start with the government it doesn't  




19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,440
## even start with farms it starts with you it starts 
## with the consumer the consumers who demand the  




20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,400
## products and there's many different ways that 
## you can create demand for animal exploitation  




21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,000
## you may not necessarily purchase it may be given 
## to you you may be wearing secondhand leather  




22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,880
## somebody might pay for your ticket to go to a zoo 
## there's many other circumstances i could point out  




23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,960
## but you are creating demand and you're promoting 
## that this culture of animal exploitation within  




24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,240
## humans is okay it's acceptable and that's 
## what i mean by starting with us with humans  




25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:46,960
## and what we do on the streets is we focus on the 
## demand we start from where it starts and it's not  




26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,880
## to say that it isn't important to work in the 
## political sphere to end things like government  




27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,840
## subsidies for animal agriculture that is a worthy 
## fight and i would like to see that succeed i would  




28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,960
## also like to see more of the direct action 
## stuff that holds the corporations accountable  




29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,720
## but what we also really need is to start from 
## where it starts which is the consumer demand so  




30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,400
## that's why we do what we do always remember 
## that you will never have 100 success rate  




31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
## in animal rights outreach there is no magic 
## set of words to use during outreach that  




32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
## will make someone go vegan if they're ready 
## they'll listen if they're not ready they won't  




33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,000
## this is a very important point for you guys 
## to understand because you might get down on  




34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
## yourself if you don't get through to somebody and 
## you may think that you've said everything correct  




35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,680
## and you may have said it all correctly but at the 
## end of the day it comes down to the individual  




36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,040
## whether they're willing and open to change 
## and take action with the context provided your  




37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
## function as an activist is to hold the individual 
## you're speaking with accountable for the animal  




38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,400
## abuse that they are responsible for and make 
## them aware of the consequences of their choices




39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
## your goal as an activist on the streets doing 
## outreach at the cubes is not to plant seeds  




40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:20,560
## animal rights outreach is not verbal leafleting 
## what we mean by that is you're not just riffing  




41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,720
## off information and factoids to people you're not 
## literally a brochure in human form you're not just  




42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,160
## telling people about how old chickens are when 
## they die how many chickens are killed you know  




43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,240
## etc um the whole point is you're actually 
## interacting with somebody and you know there  




44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,120
## are certain facts and information that need to be 
## used at certain points throughout the interaction  




45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,640
## but for the most part most people prefer things to 
## be kept simple you might have heard the expression  




46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,400
## kiss keep it simple stupid it really does 
## apply to the majority of the public especially
