00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,720
## all right we are live welcome all to this 
## very special david rams live stream where  




2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,360
## we're going to be joined by paul and nassau from 
## anonymous for the voiceless to discuss a load of  




3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,680
## different rumors accusations i laugh because some 
## of them are pretty funny but no some of them are  




4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,040
## very serious rumors accusations and a whole load 
## of questions that you've been sending to me um  




5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
## that you want to ask paula nasal the co-founders 
## of anonymous for the voiceless we're going to  




6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
## go through all of these things but first of all i 
## just want to do a bit of housekeeping with you so  




7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,880
## if you are watching this later 
## as in you're not watching it live  




8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,520
## if you check across the bottom the progress bar 
## you will see it's been split up into sections  




9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
## so if you want to find the specific question room 
## or accusation or whatever that you're looking for  




10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,880
## you can find it right there if you have questions 
## yourself right now and you are watching this live  




11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,880
## right now you have questions uh we're gonna do a q 
## a at the end so save them for that but if you have  




12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,640
## a topic or a question that you really really want 
## to be asked right now or or sooner you can use the  




13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,240
## super chat if you use a super chat i will pause 
## and we'll answer your question right away but  




14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,400
## but there is a caveat there is a disclaimer here 
## if you are spamming trolling or abusing anyone  




15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
## in any way including if you send a super chat and 
## you pay for a super chat and it's a spam or abuse  




16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
## it won't be discussed so you'll be wasting your 
## money i just want to make that very clear for you  




17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,160
## and that also goes for the live chat 
## and it goes for the q a at the end  




18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,360
## we won't be tolerating any spam or any trolling or 
## any abuse so the moderator will be handling that  




19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,720
## i hope it doesn't come to that but i know a lot 
## of the topics that we're going to discuss are a  




20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,760
## little bit controversial so i expect that there 
## will be at least one or two um so all that being  




21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,720
## said yeah just keep it sensible keep it polite 
## and we'll have a a productive live stream that's  




22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,400
## pretty much it so with that being said let's 
## bring in paul nasal welcome paul welcome myself  




23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,160
## hey what's up how you doing good how are you 
## oh good all good all good i'm excited to get  




24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,560
## through this and i think a lot of people in the 
## comments have been pretty pumped as well to uh  




25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,000
## you know get through this um i know for you too 
## this is basically like you're repeating yourself  




26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,320
## a lot of these things because over the years 
## i think i think we've been through this a few  




27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,520
## times or your own channels and in your own social 
## medias but there are a few people at least a few  




28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,920
## people here that have been asking a few of the the 
## questions already and a lot of people have been  




29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,400
## sending me questions so i'm happy we can we can 
## do this and you know hopefully once and for all  




30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,880
## get everything discussed in one place so i really 
## appreciate you coming on and doing this i know  




31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,200
## it's not the easiest thing to do um so we can 
## kick off i suppose let's just kick straight in  




32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
## right i mean let's not waste any time we're 
## here for a reason let's kick off with the  




33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,840
## recent there's the most recent stuff that's been 
## going on right now i think most people watching  




34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
## are going to be here probably off the back of that 
## i think i don't think we need to really introduce  




35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
## what av is and who you are i think anybody 
## watching this is going to know that already  




36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,280
## so let's just jump in with the recent 
## stuff and what's been going on with av with  




37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,480
## the the whole situation with joey the situation 
## with animal safe movement anita the donor um  




38
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,800
## where are we up to with this now could you give 
## us an update on that just to kick things off




39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,880
## so we reached out to the donor 
## to find out if this was a genuine




40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,480
## um thing you know to legitimately 
## continue donating to av  




41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:03,040
## and they replied with more demands on top 
## of everything that was discussed in the  




42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,520
## videos we put out and everything that joey had 
## mentioned so even more demands on top of that




43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,920
## that we had to respond to but we of course 
## ourselves had things that we needed to communicate  




44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,200
## to the donor i mean there's obviously a break 
## in trust at this point and we need to have a  




45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,120
## conversation and re-establish that trust and 
## things like this and we haven't heard back  




46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,360
## since we've replied so that was over almost 
## a month ago now and we haven't heard back  




47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
## what were the extra requirements they were 
## they were giving you like what did they add




48
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
## one of them was for us to delete 
## these videos that we put up  




49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,840
## about joey and that that was pretty 
## telling of what this was really about




50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,680
## right right and what did they give her like 
## any kind of justification for wanting that done
