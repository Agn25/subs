00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:12,160
## cows and pigs and chickens these trucks are being 
## driven to concentration camp slaughterhouses  




124
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,960
## that we've carefully constructed all across 
## america when the trucks arrive the animals are  




125
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:27,120
## so frightened they won't even get off the truck 
## they're not stupid they know what's next so people  




126
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,840
## go on the trucks with electric prods and force 
## them to walk down the chutes to their own death  




127
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,280
## or if the animals are small enough to manhandle 
## like chickens we'll just grab them off the trucks  




128
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:46,320
## and toss them inside inside these innocent living 
## beings are hanged upside down fully conscious  




129
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,240
## in other words they go in alive against their will 
## and come out chopped up into hundreds of pieces  




130
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:07,120
## but you know what's more insane than that meat 
## eaters walking around like their lifestyle isn't  




131
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:16,560
## causing any harm like it's normal and natural 
## to be consuming violence and death how would you  




132
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:25,120
## feel if the day that you were born somebody else 
## had already planned the day of your execution




133
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,360
## that's what it's like to be a cow a pig a 
## chicken or a turkey on this planet i think  




134
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,720
## i think this type of behavior is inexcusable an 
## unbecoming of a species that claims to understand  




135
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,600
## right from wrong the animals have not done 
## one single thing to us to deserve the wrath  




136
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,120
## and the cruelty that we hurl on them and i hope 
## you all understand what i'm offering you today  




137
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,840
## when you hit the door after my speech are 
## you aware that for the first time ever  




138
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,040
## you can now directly participate in ending a 
## massacre instead of sitting around and paying  




139
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,560
## lip service to all the massacres and all the 
## problems that are always going on on this planet  




140
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,440
## what is so frustrating to me when i travel this 
## country doing around 250 lectures every year to  




141
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:31,840
## some 7 500 students is that everybody talks a good 
## game i've noticed that people are quite the smooth  




142
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,240
## talkers when it comes to peace and compassion i 
## mean people always want to tell me never show me  




143
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,440
## just tell me how peaceful they are because of 
## what they believe in or what makes them sad  




144
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,120
## hey gary i believe in god and i believe in angels 
## and i pray all the time and those earthquakes the  




145

## __ ] it was sad since when does feeling sad about  




146

## i'm just not a politician i'm not a [ __ ] artist 
## i don't know how to schmooze people as you can see  




149
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,200
## it's kind of beyond me i hope you appreciate my 
## honesty and my genuineness today and i'm not a

## salesperson i got no books to sell you after my 
## lecture no dvds and no documentaries no collection

## don't want your email addresses and i don't want  




152
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,120
## your mailing addresses keep all that stuff i am 
## here to talk about the worst form of cruelty and  




153
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,440
## violence taking place on this planet even though 
## most people don't seem to care about it but when  




154
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,520
## you sit back in the comfort of your living room 
## and you start condemning atrocities elsewhere  




155
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:09,040
## that is pure unadulterated lip service that's the 
## definition of lip service but veganism this is now

## a chance to actually walk the compassionate 
## talk that everybody's always talking about  




157
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,280
## this is your chance to show others how truly 
## peaceful you are this is a chance for a personal  




158
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:29,760
## revolution to leave your mark on this planet by 
## causing the least amount of harm possible always  




159
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,840
## being vegan now come on what's the argument 
## for not causing the least amount of harm  




160
