## because they stole mine too and they got me good 
## but i got it all back and that's the only reason  




962

## i'm here today to try and help you get yours 
## back as well most people eat dairy products three  




963
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:31,760
## times a day but you can't even get a sandwich 
## anymore without cheese people put cheese and meat  




964
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:37,440
## on salads too and by the way if you're 
## eating a salad with meat and cheese on it  




965
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:42,640
## it's not a salad stop that [ __ ] it's a sandwich 
## without the bread all chopped up little pieces put  




966
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:49,840
## inside of a bowl spare me the chicken salad tuna 
## salad crap a salad is comprised of vegetables and  




967
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,400
## plant products only and if you're lucky enough 
## to find this vegetable only salad somewhere  




968
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,280
## what's the first thing people have 
## to say to the waiter like an addict  




969
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:04,880
## yeah hey uh can i get some ranch or some thousand 
## island can you please pour some dairy all over  




970
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:11,200
## these vegetables for me so in our society where 
## everybody is hooked on dairy i mean hooked like  




971
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:17,840
## it's been laced with cocaine and percocet most 
## people can't even fathom one meal little in one  




972
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:23,040
## day or a lifetime without cheese in fact if you 
## want to know why vegetarians never become vegans  




973
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,960
## cheese cheese on a baked potato cheese on a 
## broccoli cheese on everything and say even  




974
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,760
## lactose intolerant people eat cheese i want to 
## spend a little more time right now condemning the  




975
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:41,040
## dairy industry because when it comes to cruelty 
## i think there's more cruelty in a piece of cheese  




976
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:49,600
## and a glass of milk in yogurt than there is in 
## meat first of all most hamburger meat comes from  




977
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:55,840
## the dairy industry when cows can't produce 
## huge amounts of milk after three to seven years  




978
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:06,560
## slaughterhouse if given a chance god forbid cows 
## can live to be 18 to 25 and cows are like all  




979
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:11,120
## female mammals listen i don't mean to be speaking 
## down anybody if that's how you're taking this  




980
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,480
## it's just that when i'm talking to addicts about 
## their addictions addicts have a tendency to become  




981
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:21,760
## irrational and illogical i know you understand 
## this concept you just never think about it when  




982
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:32,000
## it comes to the animals female mammals can only 
## produce and give milk during or after pregnancy




983
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:41,920
## so once a year every cow on every dairy farm 
## is raped to impregnate her long steel device  




984
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:46,800
## shoved in her vagina to inject her with bull 
## scene and sometimes you just use a bare hand  




985
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,800
## to do it got to get that milk flow going somehow 
## and later on after she gives birth her newborn  




986
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:58,640
## baby is stolen away a couple months later they 
## repeat the process all over again one of the  




987
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:04,320
## worst screams i have ever heard and i've heard 
## them all firsthand i've been to slaughterhouses  




988
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,400
## vivisection labs behind the scenes of every 
## circus and rodeo that were passed through michigan  




989
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,960
## one of the worst screams i've ever heard 
## stealing newborn babies from their mothers  




990
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:19,360
## and why would they steal newborn babies from 
## their moms well the dairy industry can't have  




991
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:24,800
## calves sucking up all that milk that was meant 
## for them and they'd rather sell it to you instead  




992
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:33,520
## every time you have dairy some calf does 
## not and mother cows make milk for one reason  




993
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:40,800
## for their babies case clothes forever no debate 
## no discussion the jury is in they certainly don't  




994
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:45,760
## make milk for baby elephants and baby orangutans 
## and baby hedgehogs baby rabbits baby rats baby  




995
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:54,080
## humans adolescent humans or adult humans this 
## body of ours has absolutely no need for cow milk  




996
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:59,520
## like it has absolutely no need for giraffe 
## milk and zebra milk and rhinoceros milk and  




997
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,800
## hippopotamus milk chamomile goat milk horse milk 
## pig milk dog milk or cat milk the only milk that  




998
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:14,240
## we ever need comes from our own mother our species 
## that's it and after the first few years of life we  




999
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,880
## never need one drop of milk ever again and don't 
## think i don't watch your faces when i'm up here  




1000
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:24,720
## that's what i do when i'm preaching i'm watching 
## all your expressions how come when i talk about

## wrinkle up their noses a little eyes get a little 
## wide and bold just start glancing around the room  




1003

## seitan seitan by the way not satan seitan it is 
## wheat meat it is meat that is made from wheat  




1005
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,880
## so how come tofu and even fruits and veggies 
## are considered gross to most people but meat  




1006
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:58,080
## time to break meat down for everybody 
## you got five components to meat  




1007
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:05,440
## blood flesh veins muscles and tendons the
