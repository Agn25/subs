00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,440
## division between us and individuals it's not about 
## being deliberately combative and creating division  




229
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,320
## with people it's again just about making sure that 
## they understand clearly that there is a massive  




230
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,880
## difference between veganism and non-veganism 
## and i think you all already know this because  




231
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,280
## otherwise you wouldn't be vegan and you wouldn't 
## stay vegan and you understand that there is a  




232
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,040
## big difference between what you're doing now and 
## going back to being non-vegan a huge difference  




233
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,960
## and that's why we should really be careful 
## about the language we use okay why versus how  




234
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,880
## people already know how to go vegan it's really 
## simple stuff with the constant availability of  




235
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,240
## google and the internet anybody can figure out 
## how to become vegan instantly in order for people  




236
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,920
## to feel the need to become vegan they need to 
## be held accountable for why they should do it  




237
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:15,360
## with any other injustice you would never focus 
## on how by talking about how to not participate  




238
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:23,040
## in the violence focusing on the how in the context 
## of any other injustice would be an insult to the  




239
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,880
## victims and the entire movement fighting to 
## end their oppression part of me it's not to  




240
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,760
## say that how is not an important talking point we 
## should give people that but it's only at the very  




241
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,480
## end once we have sufficiently and emphatically 
## address the why factor you know we give people  




242
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,040
## a card as you know at the end we always arm 
## people with the resources and the how factor  




243
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:54,640
## all you really need as a compass to be vegan is 
## is what i'm doing right now vegan or not does this  




244
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,080
## restaurant have vegan meals is this product vegan 
## is this ingredient vegan is going to zoos vegan  




245
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,840
## okay so it's really simple really really simple 
## stuff and i think that you should be aware of  




246
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,440
## whether you're coddling people into this or 
## not and babying people into this is a problem  




247
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
## it shows weakness in the actual 
## message if you're doing that  




248
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,200
## vegetarianism is cancer to animal rights i'm not 
## just saying this for shock value i truly mean this  




249
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,240
## the longer the vegetarianism and veganism 
## get conflated the longer it will take  




250
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,760
## for us to get the message out there that 
## veganism is about non-human animal rights  




251
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
## and that that is a serious injustice that 
## people need to take very very seriously  




252
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,840
## vegetarians are non-vegans and should be 
## outreached in the same manner as anyone else  




253
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,000
## and in most cases even harder vegetarians are our 
## target market they're no different to paleo eaters  




254
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,600
## people who eat a paleo diet why should we treat 
## them any differently so as you may know people who  




255
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,120
## eat a paleo diet do not eat dairy and we as vegans 
## i use this point a lot and i hear other vegans  




256
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,040
## using this point a lot we talk about how the 
## dairy industry is quite possibly the cruelest  




257
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,800
## industry at least for land animals on earth 
## paleo eaters don't consume any dairy products




258
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840
## why are they any different to 
## vegetarians vegetarians don't consume  




259
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:50,800
## flesh while flesh is an obvious form of cruelty 
## we know as vegans that dairy is no different  




260
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,680
## and that what happens on dairy farms and in 
## slaughterhouses to the cows and their babies  




261
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,440
## is nothing short of an atrocity of a holocaust 
## and is no different to what happens to animals  




262
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,600
## in the meat industry arguably it's worse than 
## the dairy industry and so as you can imagine it  




263
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,920
## would be insane for us to call paleo people our 
## allies to put them in the same bracket as vegans  




264
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,800
## so why are we doing this with vegetarians it 
## makes absolutely no sense it's counterproductive  




265
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,680
## and it absolutely will marginalize the 
## seriousness of this injustice the longer  




266
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,440
## that we make vegetarians feel like they are animal 
## people like they are defenders of animals like  




267
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,680
## they are on the side of animal rights they need 
## to be held to account just like everybody else




268
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,600
## okay so they are not allies don't let other vegans 
## or non-vegans manipulate you into thinking that  




269
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,280
## they are so when you start the conversation you 
## could say would you like to know why we're here  




270
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,560
## what's up guys how you doing man i'm doing really 
## well you wanna hear what we're doing oh sure
