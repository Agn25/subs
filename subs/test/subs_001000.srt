00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,720
## they used to make us laugh and giggle and 
## smile they made us pretty happy and there was  




82
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,960
## a time in our lives when we would do just about 
## anything in the world to make them happy as well  




83
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,640
## to protect them from cruelty or to at least 
## acknowledge the cruelty they were receiving  




84
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
## i mean if somebody was mean to an animal 
## in front of us when we were little  




85
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,280
## we would have screamed and cried and that's 
## because we all used to understand right from  




86
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,440
## wrong when it came to the treatment of animals 
## until somebody told us and taught us differently  




87
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,400
## you better believe somebody told us to ignore 
## their suffering to mock and excuse their pain and  




88
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,880
## their misery to make fun of their very existence 
## and this is something i want you to focus on today  




89
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,960
## tomorrow and beyond what in the hell happened 
## along the way who taught us to be so mean  




90
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,200
## and nasty and vicious and hateful or indifferent 
## towards animals when they used to be our friends  




91
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,800
## these are innocent beings who have done nothing 
## wrong to us because i'm pretty sure we can all  




92
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:21,600
## agree in at least one thing right now that hatred 
## in its purest form is a learned behavior racism  




93
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,720
## sexism heterosexism anti-semitism misogyny these 
## are all learned behaviors when kids are two three  




94
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,280
## four years old playing on a playground they could 
## care less about the color of their friend's skin  




95
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,160
## or their religious background i don't think 
## there's any doubt that hatred in its purest  




96
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,360
## form is learned so speciesism is no different 
## this could be a new word to a lot of people  




97
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
## it's up here on the screen right below vegan 
## the word species with an ism attached to it  




98
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,960
## and i want to define this word as the unethical 
## on principled point of view that the human  




99
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,720
## species has every right to exploit 
## enslave and murder another species  




100
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,480
## and all because we believe that our species is 
## so more special so more superior than the other  




101
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,360
## ones we're the only ones that count and we're the 
## only ones that matter now correct me if i'm wrong




102
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,160
## but that line of thinking that thought process 
## that is the basis of all forms of discrimination  




103
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,040
## one group saying and thinking they're more special 
## than everyone else and they proceed to exploit  




104
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,280
## them oppress them denying them their right to be 
## free they treat them like property they enslave  




105
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,440
## them in many cases and in many other cases 
## they murder them with premeditation and without  




106
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,120
## penalty and understand something essential about 
## discrimination it is never okay to be picking and  




107
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,240
## choosing which forms of discrimination to be 
## opposed to which ones to say are evil racism  




108
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,120
## and which ones to say are okay speciesism 
## discrimination is evil on its foundation  




109
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,560
## or it's not you cannot have this one both ways it 
## doesn't work like that i want to ask you to use  




110
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,440
## some empathy right now and when i say empathy what 
## i'm saying is is place yourself in the position  




111
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,400
## of the animals and start to view this issue from 
## the animal's point of view from the victim's point  




112
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,040
## of view when you examine any form of injustice 
## whether humans are victims or animals or victims  




113
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,880
## please remember the victim's point of view if you 
## are not the victim don't examine it entirely from  




114
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,640
## your point of view because when you're not the 
## victim it becomes pretty easy to rationalize and  




115
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:08,160
## excuse cruelty injustice inequality slavery 
## and even murder but when you're the victim




116
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,680
## things look a lot differently from that 
## anger now i want to show a do you ever wonder  




117
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,080
## why mcdonald's and burger king and wendy's 
## never show you those images in their tv ads  




118
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,160
## instead they show you smiling cartoon 
## caricatures of animals singing and  




119
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,840
## dancing and playing lying to you 
## brainwashing you programming you  




120
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,720
## not to care about things you would normally 
## care about things that you used to care about




121
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:52,480
## right now at this very moment on american highways 
## there are no less than 5 000 concentration camp  




122
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:03,280
## trucks trucks that we've constructed inside these 
## trucks there are living terrified innocent beings
