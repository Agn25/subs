183
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,080
## but that's where i learned it and it 
## applies to almost everything in life  




184
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:19,280
## and in essence at its very basis sales applies 
## to life you know if you have children and they  




185
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:26,160
## love to eat confectionery every day for every 
## meal convincing them to eat a carrot is sales  




186
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,320
## i'm convincing you right now to take this 
## approach seriously and to follow this protocol  




187
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:40,800
## while you're at cubes of truth but my point is 
## that it can get blown out of proportion and like  




188
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,760
## i said it doesn't necessarily mean everything that 
## you've learned in sales is applicable in activism  




189
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,480
## a successful conversation is not one where the 
## bystander says i'm going vegan it's where you say  




190
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,200
## the right things this is really important 
## again like i was saying before some people  




191
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,120
## may not seem open and willing they may not 
## give you the answer that you're looking for  




192
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,120
## when people say i'm going vegan that's obviously a 
## good indication but they may not be they may just  




193
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,280
## be excited in the moment they may not be genuine 
## about that the best way to measure whether you've  




194
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,120
## had a good interaction is to look at what 
## you've said have you said the correct thing  




195
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,000
## on behalf of the animals or not if you have 
## you've done the best that you can possibly do  




196
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,360
## most people become vegan after they hear the truth 
## from us how long it takes is up to the individual  




197
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,840
## the socratic method just by show of hands how 
## many of you don't know about the socratic method




198
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,240
## okay there's a few of you so socratic method 
## it's named after socrates and essentially what he  




199
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,560
## taught was when you're in a debate with somebody 
## and this is more of a debate tactic so that's  




200
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,280
## why it's not applicable in its entirety to an 
## outreach conversation because the whole thing  




201
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,080
## isn't necessarily a debate the whole thing is 
## an interaction that will involve some parts of  




202
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,680
## it being a debate and so what he taught was 
## instead of framing something as a statement  




203
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,280
## in this context for example animal cruelty is 
## wrong right that's a statement the better way to  




204
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,240
## frame it is as a question what do you think about 
## animal cruelty do you think that animal cruelty  




205
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,600
## is wrong or how do you feel about animal cruelty 
## so one of those variations was a closed question  




206
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,280
## and two of them was an open-ended question we'll 
## get into the open-ended questions in this slide  




207
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,880
## so credit questioning is a communication tool 
## that we use within our approach it is not an  




208
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,040
## approach in and of itself where we ask questions 
## to lead the bystander to their own conclusions  




209
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,680
## use open-ended questions such as why are you 
## against animal abuse instead of a closed statement  




210
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:12,480
## such as animal abuse is wrong open-ended questions 
## are generally preferred to anchor and progress the  




211
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,680
## conversation you should use closed-ended 
## questions and statements also but usually  




212
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,960
## an open-ended question does a better 
## job sometimes you just need to seal  




213
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,720
## off and confirm an aspect of what it is that 
## you're discussing at that particular moment  




214
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,560
## and that's where the closed-ended questions are 
## important okay this is important you versus we  




215
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,800
## we don't torture and kill animals for products 
## non-vegans do using we undermines individual  




216
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,800
## accountability this has been a personal lesson for 
## me and something that we've all learned within av  




217
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,840
## for quite some time now but essentially what we 
## do as activists is we find ourselves saying we  




218
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,520
## we with non-vegans all the time why do we do this 
## to animals you know we grow up i know that we're  




219
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,160
## trying to relate to non-vegans but it does take 
## away from individual accountability and people do  




220
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,400
## need to understand the clear difference between 
## veganism and non-veganism and they will not see  




221
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,280
## and understand that difference clearly enough 
## if you keep using language that isn't accurately  




222
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,800
## describing the issue if you keep saying we you're 
## not actually being accurate so be careful about  




223
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,880
## what it is you're saying when you tell non-vegans 
## that we as a society are responsible for animal  




224
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,520
## cruelty in farms it takes away the imperative 
## for individual accountability it makes them  




225
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,080
## think of lobbying or government programs instead 
## of personal responsibilities people need to feel  




226
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,920
## guilty to change they'll only change once they 
## understand that there is a difference between you  




227
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:06,960
## the vegan and them the non-vegan i understand that 
## that last slide might seem like we are creating
