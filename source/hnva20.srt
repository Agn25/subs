thank you guys appreciate the feedback 
all right so now i'm going to move on  

22
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:28,160
to the next thing great all right so yeah we're 
in lockdown here in australia and currently uh  

23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,040
we can only assemble 10 people max in a 
public area and so given that restriction  

24
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
it's going to be really difficult for 
any cubes to happen i'm going to be doing  

25
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,760
a limited attendance cube in melbourne 
tomorrow we'll see how we go with that but  

26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,320
yeah because of the restrictions around 
the world we only have um 170 odd  

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,640
uh almost up to 200 i think i haven't even checked 
the figures over the last couple of days but  

28
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,800
yeah i uh i had a look at the figures last 
and was impressed that we have almost 200  

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,840
events scheduled given the 
restrictions that we have so  

30
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,040
yeah last year we had 500 cubes scheduled 
around the world and as you may or may not  

31
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,800
know international cube day is the biggest day of 
the year for us because it's our biggest campaign  

32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,440
and the essence of it in case you don't know is 
to do as many cubes around the world as possible  

33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,120
so it's a fantastic time of the year for us 
but given the restrictions it's a limited

34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,840
campaign

35
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,160
all right what's up vegan king all right so 
let's get into this we're gonna start off oh i  

36
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,160
need to send out a quick story to everybody on 
instagram telling them that we are now live so  

37
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,440
just bear with me i've got no one moderating 
this stream i'm going to be doing it myself

38
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
um if you have any questions

39
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,200
please try to save them until i do a q a but 
if you can't wait until then drop them in the  

40
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:24,720

at some point happening now on youtube cool

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,000
all right

42
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,000
isaac you can moderate that would be a huge 
help yeah i just it won't take much work

43
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,920
ah yeah cool no worries if someone wants to 
moderate though it won't take much work i  

44
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,760
just want to i just don't want to be dealing 
with trolls and [ __ ] but it's no big deal  

45
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,920
even if they do come up you know if they 
want to come on and try to wreck my stream  

46
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,840

is i'm going to play this live for you guys  

49
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,720

you live and the first thing i need to do here  

50
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,680
is since i haven't done this in a while i need to

51
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,040
i need to remember how to share the screen 
correctly i remember how to do it but not  

52
00:06:51,040 --> 00:07:02,720

and i'll have it ready you know what i think i  

53
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:11,040
will take some questions to begin with let me 
know if you have any and i'll kill some time  

54
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,840
during that whilst i get this ready so if you 
have any questions hit me up in the comments

55
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840

58
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:14,160
to interact with you well i would 
like to do more streams all right

59
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:28,880
why is it doing that yeah so again if you have 
any questions let me know in the comments and  

60
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,960
i'll go ahead and answer them for you now here's 
a question what's your opinion on wild animal  

61
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
suffering it's a topic i recently discovered 
i don't know if you've heard of it or not  

62
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,680
might have seen it in might have seen it from 
humane hancock okay so i did respond to this  

63
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,800
uh on my instagram so i forget what i 
said exactly but i said something like  

64
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,760
let's just focus i mean my answer to this question 
is pretty straightforward let's just focus on the  

65
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,200
human inflicted suffering on animals that we 
are currently i mean it's the biggest issue  

66
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,800
that we have to be accountable for so we need 
to look in the mirror before we start trying  

67
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,240
to intervene further in the animal kingdom 
can we just stop murdering animals first can  

68
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
we stop enslaving torturing and murdering them 
that's what i would like to address this whole  

69
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
thing and i think this is what i said in my 
instagram post this whole thing is such an  

70
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,640
odd discussion to me it's so strange and uh 
it reminds me of how off-base it is for human  

71
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:43,760
beings to explore and discover the universe and 
space to the extent that humans do and yet we  

72
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
still have 80 percent of the ocean 80 percent 
completely undiscovered unobserved unexamined

73
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:00,640
you know this is just very typical of humans 
i think that we don't address we don't look  

74
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,480
into everything that's right here before us it 
starts with us and then here on this planet we  

75
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
want to try to find a home on mars and yet we 
don't even know how to get things right here

76
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:22,560
it makes no sense so that's my answer 
to that all right so next question um

77
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,520
um

78
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
all right so

79
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
long day yeah cool that sounds good laura

80
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,840
both three hour cubes you're doing 
two for international cube day awesome

81
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,320
cool a question here about whether it has 
started or not we are about to get started  

82
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:13,840
i'm taking some questions just to get this started 
and then we're going to get into the meat of this

83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
uh much love sylvia thank you for the support

84
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
and thank you for representing us

85
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,200
how to talk to a parent or turn how to talk to 
a parent to turn them vegan if he or she doesn't  

86
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,160
want to hear about animal suffering anytime 
i try to talk about he she walks out of the  

87
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:48,640
room and hangs up the phone etc agatha aguita's 
question regarding parents it's no different to  

88
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
talking to anybody else you hold human beings 
accountable for the evils they commit against  

89
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,800
non-human animals whether they're family or 
friends doesn't matter because they're guilty just  

90
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,160
the same as anybody else the thing with family is 
you obviously have more of an affinity with family  

91
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:18,640
and that means that you should give them more 
patience more effort more of an explanation more  

92
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:29,600
not an explanation it's just more time more time 
but at a certain point you have to say to yourself  

93
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:39,120
i have done my best and they aren't open 
and willing to end their human supremacy

94
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,640
and i know it's a hard road to walk but it's the 
truth and i have dedicated myself to truth on this  

95
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,760
planet i want my life to be dedicated to that and 
nothing else so so that comes first i'm a human  

96
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:06,000
being dedicated to truth before i am a human being 
that belongs to a family does that make sense  

97
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
um i also do think that family could be 
one of the biggest downfalls of society

98
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
but i'm not going to get into that all 
right so moving on another question here  

99
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
about overpopulation i'm just going 
to quickly answer this but this is  

100
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,280
going to be the last question i answer 
before we get started and i want to  

101
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,280
thank you for your patience guys all 
right so the next question here is

102
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,280
when we've solved the overpopulation of pet 
animal issue do you think that we can still have  

103
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,680
companion animals but create a solution when none 
die in shelters yeah absolutely like sanctuaries  

104
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,840
all of these shelters should be turned 
into sanctuaries instead of a kill business

105
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
all right i'm going to get started 
now guys thanks for your patience so  

106
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,840
i'm going to share my screen i'm going to 
need your feedback in the comments so please  

107
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:15,840
light it up with feedback 
about the video and the audio

108
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,840
okay down that's come on

109
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:57,840
uh okay

110
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,560
okay i'm gonna have to this is ten years ago 
but the temperament of the times right now  

111
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,080
from what i can see is that most people already 
get sorry about that guys i didn't realize that  

112
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:21,120
was playing uh okay so i'm gonna have to unplug 
this mic when i'm playing and then plug it back  

113
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,880
in when i need to make commentary technical 
nonsense but it is what it is so let me just

114
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
yeah let me just get this going for you

115
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,560
guys okay

116
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,840
can you guys see that okay 
i'm sharing my screen now

117
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,120
i'm sharing my screen right now so please let 
me know in the comments if you can see that and

118
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:27,280
i'm gonna start playing right now okay thanks 
my name is paul bashir i am my name my name  

119
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,800
is paul bashir i am the co-founder and 
director of anonymous for the voiceless  

120
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,200
i became an animal rights activist in 
june of 2015 and i started av with my  

121
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:50,080
partner who i met basically just before we started 
av asal and we started av in april of 2016.  

122
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,800
since then we've become one of the most prominent 
animal rights organizations in the world not  

123
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,960
that it's a goal of ours necessarily at 
the moment to have a billion chapters  

124
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,800
that was our goal but we've changed that now to 
wanting to have chapters who are working with us  

125
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,160
working in alignment with what we're trying to 
achieve and what we set out to achieve when we  

126
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,840
started av this workshop is an attempt to do 
that with regards to outreach as you all know  

127
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,280
at the cube of truth we have protocols we have 
rules and we have structure and we find that  

128
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,720
really important because the more serious we take 
our roles on the streets or in general the more  

129
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,640
serious people take us and the message as you know 
we have rules like wearing all black at the cubes  

130
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,320
we wear the masks and only one kind of mask in the 
cube we form a square cube structure there's the  

131
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,880
outreach team in the cube team so we have these 
kinds of structures another thing that we have  

132
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,560
as a standardized structure is the outreach and 
that's what i'm going to be talking to you about  

133
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:58,080
today and the standard outreach approach that we 
expect at the cubes is there to help you and help  

134
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,640
everybody that does outreach to be effective 
and the only thing i've found to be fulfilling  

135
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,960
in this line of work is effective activism it's 
the only thing that will help you to process the  

136
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,720
frustration and the anger that you will naturally 
have if you're paying attention as you may know  

137
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,120
you've seen some outreach from me but it's from 
the earlier stages and only recently did i start  

138
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:28,160
putting outreach content up online last year there 
was a gap where i wasn't putting outreach content  

139
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,080
up online and that's because i was being patient 
and i was applying different approaches and i  

140
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,120
wanted to see what stuck what didn't i'm teaching 
you nuts and bolts stuff here that i've observed  

141
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,400
i've learned i've applied and i have observed 
others apply and i can deem confidently now works  

142
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,760
effectively for everybody this is also an approach 
that is truly for everybody but i'm going to start  

143
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,360
from the very top here with the definition 
of veganism because in our movement right now  

144
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
veganism is confused like everybody has a 
different definition have you noticed this  

145
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,720
does this bother you guys yeah don't you wish 
we're on the same page about this wouldn't it be  

146
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,320
easier i don't know why we're so confused about 
it it seems pretty straightforward but i'll get  

147
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,960
into the definition of veganism for you it's a way 
of living that seeks to exclude any form of animal  

148
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,520
exploitation as much as practicably possible 
in the definition it doesn't include anything  

149
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,200
to do with the environment it doesn't include 
anything to do with human health it's purely about  

150
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,480
animals and their rights and it really is that 
simple another thing i'd like to tell you and  

151
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,480
this has helped me to understand the function of 
an activist is to be a medium of truth because  

152
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,280
truth exists in this world but it doesn't act on 
its own so we need to act and we need to speak the  

153
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,680
truth we need to continually speak the truth 
and we need to act on it as much as possible  

154
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,720
so that's your role as an activist and it really 
is that simple but if you ever get lost and you  

155
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
are ever in doubt just remember you're 
speaking for the animals in the same way you  

156
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,840
would want to be spoken for if you're in their 
position telling people the truth shouldn't be  

157
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,800
perceived by you as something that will start 
a fight because if you perceive it that way  

158
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,120
maybe others will pick up on that but if you just 
think that you're telling people the truth because  

159
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,200
that's the loving thing to do then people will 
pick up on that as well and they respect truth  

160
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,040
people respect people who tell them the truth 
have you ever heard the expression that you  

161
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,600
don't lie to your friends you shouldn't 
lie to your friends well if you extend that  

162
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,960
to the public isn't that what being compassionate 
is so people conflate veganism with compassionate  

163
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,320
living a lot of the times as well i don't think 
not stabbing animals to death is necessarily  

164
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,840
compassionate i just think that's 
the same and rational thing to do  

165
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,680
but people also claim that this approach is not 
compassionate that we're not being compassionate  

166
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,720
to the abusers not giving them a chance but that's 
nonsense because i'm a street activist that's all  

167
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,400
i do is educate people i give people a chance to 
wake up to this like i was i'm not forcing people  

168
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,400
to go vegan that's physically impossible to do if 
that was possible i'd probably be doing it right  

169
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,440
now but you can't do that so you have to focus 
on just talking to people and hoping they wake up  

170
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
and that is the most compassionate thing 
that you can do is offer people education  

171
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
but again telling people the truth is 
truly the most loving thing that you can do  

172
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,320
i don't know why we think it's hateful 
people say you're shaming people  

173
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,800
we're not necessarily shaming people 
we are making people feel guilty though  

174
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,240
because how else are we going to make people go 
vegan if they don't feel guilty isn't that why  

175
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,760
you went vegan because you felt incredibly guilty 
for what you were contributing to well why would  

176
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,720
we avoid having others feel that why would we 
try to avoid that why would we dance around the  

177
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,320
topic and compromise on the message and panda 
when that's the goal is for them to feel guilty

178
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,840
this is the real form of compassion that i see 
that we need to bring into this movement more  

179
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,800
is telling non-vegans the truth and one thing that 
will happen when you're talking to non-vegans is  

180
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,840
you're going to notice a lot of conscious and 
some conscious distractions that come out so  

181
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,960
whether they're consciously and maliciously doing 
that or not you have to be aware of the fact that  

182
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,720
they're going to distract away from what needs to 
be discussed because their guilt is going to be  

183
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,480
flaring when you're talking about something 
that's obviously wrong everybody knows that  

184
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,080
animal abuse is wrong that's the other thing 
is that we think as vegans that people don't  

185
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,680
already know about this people walk over to a cube 
instantly know that we're vegan instantly know  

186
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,480
that we're trying to promote an animal rights 
message it may not have been the case 10 years ago  

187
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,160
but the temperament of the times right now from 
what i can see is that most people already get the  

188
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,800
fact that we're talking about animal rights we're 
talking about veganism and they need to go vegan  

189
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:29,040
that's the crux of the conversation that they're 
going to have with us so don't act like non-vegans  

190
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,000
don't know this okay they already know we're a 
lot more obvious about this than we think we are  

191
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
when we have these very simple conversations with 
people their guilt will flare up and they start  

192
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,040
creating distractions that they don't even believe 
in like plants have feelings they're trying to  

193
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,760
distract from them taking accountability 
from themselves taking accountability for  

194
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,680
what they're doing it's your role again as a 
medium of truth to anchor the conversation back  

195
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,240
to make sure that that individual is in the 
hot seat and it's not just something that they  

196
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,080
can just palm off and the distractions that 
they're creating you have to break through  

197
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,640
them that's your job as an activist is to break 
through them and not let the distractions become  

198
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,320
real distractions for what needs to be 
discussed you've all heard non-vegan  

199
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,040
excuses i'm sure a lot of people think when i 
do an outreach workshop i'm going to get into  

200
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,200
how to deal with excuses how to deal with certain 
arguments i'm not actually going to do that  

201
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,920
if you have questions during the q a though i'll 
answer them for you but i'm not going to do that  

202
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,520
because i've come to know that they're all just 
ridiculous excuses and there is no excuse under  

203
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,840
the sun that should ever trump you plants have 
feelings if people really believe that plants  

204
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,640
have feelings how come we don't have a single 
group out there that protest against lawn mowing

205
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,280
how come when the australian bushfires 
occurred we didn't hear anything about the  

206
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,960
plants burning to death we only heard about 
the wildlife and when they said wild life  

207
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,320
they were talking about animals every 
single time even people like joe rogan  

208
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
who's a [ __ ] avid hunter and loves to justify 
not being vegan at every opportunity he gets  

209
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,040
even he said he supported the wildlife in 
australia and he was referring to the koalas  

210
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:28,960
and the other animals people around the world have 
only shown empathy or sympathy towards the animals  

211
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,160
that were suffering in the wildfires right that 
just goes to show that this is very obvious in  

212
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,400
people's minds and that's why i'm saying this is 
a lot more obvious than we think it is it really  

213
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,920
is people already care about animal rights 
and the reason i know that is because nobody  

214
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,200
unless they're a psychopath would be comfortable 
with the label of being an animal abuser  

215
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,560
and that's what non-vegans are they're abusing 
animals the only reason why they feel comfortable  

216
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,600
is because the guilt is shared by everybody we've 
broken out of that now we can see straight now  

217
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,400
but it doesn't mean that it's not completely 
obvious still for everybody else we've just  

218
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,520
taken action on this none of these excuses are 
ever going to trump you they should never have  

219
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,920
you feeling flustered they should never have you 
feeling like you don't know the answer because  

220
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,200
the answer is always very simple and it's the fact 
that they can't justify abusing animals needlessly  

221
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,360
end of story whenever in doubt 
just compare to any other

222
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,160
but it should injustice like a 
delicacy and something that we eat  

223
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,400
maybe once a week instead 
of i don't think that the  

224
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,840
the rate that we use it is natural we're 
at the extreme end of this lifestyle now

225
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,680
would you say that with any 
other injustice like sexism  

226
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,880
child abuse no but i'm saying would 
you take that position would you say  

227
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,800
that it would be too extreme to avoid at 
all that we should still do it sometimes

228
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:17,280
yeah that was good that was a good rebuttal we're 
not vegan but we're vegetarian delivered chicken  

229
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:23,680
yeah so we're fish chicken so would you take the 
same position with any other injustice let's say  

230
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,440
we're talking about sexism or racism would you 
have the same view on that where are we going here  

231
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,560
so let's say we're talking about racism yeah 
would you be like i'm against racism i don't  

232
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,200
want to be a racist but then maybe 
like on sundays i make an exception

233
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,800
to be racist yeah so this is a form of 
discrimination against another species  

234
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,160
while you're still having a little bit of egg or 
chicken whatever i'm not sure what you're having  

235
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,240
you're still really supporting animal cruelty 
and more exploitation we will do it slowly i  

236
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,360
understand it might seem like a big jump would 
you take that on any other issue for example  

237
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,120
if somebody said i'm going to slowly stop 
beating my child i'm going to slowly become  

238
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,920
a non-racist no you wouldn't be uh that's we 
got to do it right do you think that we should  

239
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,440
contribute to this last or do you think that we 
should say hey we should just stop hurting animals  

240
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:36,320
stop stop right people will talk a good game about 
reducing or making excuses for why they won't go  

241
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,080
vegan just compare to any other injustice in that 
moment we are an animal rights organization we've  

242
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,240
never deemed ourselves to be an environmentalist 
group a group of environmentalists trying to  

243
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,320
change the world for the betterment of the 
environment we've never claimed to be a  

244
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
nutritionist organization a group of nutritionists 
trying to change the world for the betterment of  

245
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,520
human health we've only ever claimed to be an 
animal rights organization but there's this myth  

246
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,640
that exists in the vegan movement that when you 
promote health and environment these things will  

247
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,120
get people more interested in animal rights and 
that's the reason why we've been talking about  

248
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,960
these things is to try to get them hooked if 
someone doesn't seemingly care about animals  

249
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,600
well i guess i'll talk to them about health 
because they have heart disease i guess i'll  

250
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,040
talk to them about how they can reverse their 
heart disease by eating a plant-based diet if they  

251
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,360
don't seemingly care about the animals we think 
we'll talk to them about the environment this  

252
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,520
is destroying the rainforest this is destroying 
our climate crisis the idea that this will lead  

253
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,120
someone to animal rights and caring about animal 
rights is a complete myth animal rights is obvious  

254
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,800
nobody in their right mind would be comfortable 
with the label of being an animal abuser so  

255
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
it's not a matter of people not caring 
about animal rights it's a matter of you  

256
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,160
not promoting animal rights correctly it may 
seem like a tough pill to swallow to hear that  

257
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,960
but i'm only telling you this because it's the 
truth and it's what i've learned to be true  

258
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,400
people avoid animal rights and make you 
think they don't care about animal rights  

259
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,680
for a reason it's a distraction like i said 
they create distractions they don't want to  

260
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,960
face something that's obviously wrong and then you 
buy into that by then pandering to environment and  

261
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,400
health people don't care about animals because the 
way that we advocate veganism to people doesn't  

262
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,800
care about animals it seems like in this movement 
the more i hear people advocating for veganism  

263
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,360
the less i hear animal rights being tied into it 
they quickly get mentioned and then we move on to  

264
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,200
how this is really bad for the environment and 
really bad for your health so that's why people  

265
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,360
don't care about animal rights the vegan movement 
hasn't been promoting animal rights i also just  

266
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,360
want to say this those who say that what i'm doing 
is aggressive that this isn't compassionate well  

267
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,120
the irony the way i see it is the irony is that 
when people aren't advocating for the animals  

268
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,240
in the way that they communicate directly then 
you're actually putting the compassion you want  

269
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,240
to receive from the abuser before the compassion 
you're supposed to be extending to the victim  

270
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,080
i think that's hypocrisy right if we truly 
are compassionate beings then we need to  

271
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,880
extend compassion to the victims and when we're 
talking to the abuser like i've already explained  

272
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,640
it is actually the truest form of compassion to 
offer the abuser education what do we usually  

273
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,920
do with abusers we put them in prison don't we 
right if these beings were any other species  

274
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,560
other than a non-human so if they were human 
these people would be put in prison wouldn't  

275
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,720
they there would be no conversation 
on the streets no trying to convince  

276
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,600
people so this is compassion this is the most 
compassionate thing we can possibly do is try to  

277
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,960
wake people up with our words but if we pander 
and we move away from animal rights when we're  

278
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,400
talking to people then we're only doing more of 
an injustice more of a disservice to the animals  

279
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,680
it's not about how people feel about animals do 
you have a dog at home do you have a cat at home  

280
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,640
a lot of the times we as vegans try to lean on 
the compassion that we think they already have  

281
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,320
for animals for non-human animals we use dogs 
as examples a lot in this movement we try to say  

282
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,400
would you do this to your dog how would you 
feel if your dog was eaten what about if a  

283
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,760
dog was getting beaten up right in front of us 
right now would you act on it that blows up in  

284
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,480
our face a lot of the time replace all those 
cows with dogs just for a moment in your mind

285
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:05,600
dogs don't produce milk yes they do yeah they do 
but not like yeah it's hard to i don't i try just  

286
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:13,120
morally i make that comment just for you to 
consider it morally what is the difference between  

287
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:26,080
puppies being raised all the female puppies to 
get milk out of them instead of cows i don't feel  

288
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,800
different you don't feel any different why do we 
think we live in a society that cares about dogs  

289
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
why do we think that i don't understand why our 
movement thinks that we live in a society full  

290
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,960
of dog lovers if we truly love dogs would we have 
shelters that kill dogs by the thousand every day  

291
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,840
around the world clearly if we lived in a 
society of dog lovers just the same way that we  

292
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,120
love human children then we'd have people 
protesting at the front of shelters all the time  

293
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
but that's not happening if you said that stuff 
to me it wouldn't really work because i was never  

294
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,400
really a dog lover growing up but my point is 
to say that this isn't an animal conversation  

295
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,960
this is an accountability conversation if you 
were talking to me about the blood on my hands  

296
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
if you're talking to me about the harm i'm 
causing to beings who suffer like i suffer  

297
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,960
it doesn't matter about how i feel about animals 
it matters but how i feel about causing suffering  

298
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,240
i also need to make this clear a lot of people 
out there think that morality is subjective when  

299
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,400
it comes to this morality is as objective as 
it gets it's as black and white as my t-shirt

300
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,200
when it comes to animal rights people will love 
for you to think that there's a great area that  

301
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,480
there's something that you're not considering 
you're not open-minded enough what about  

302
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,640
if you're on a deserted island or those who don't 
have you know access to they always try to bring  

303
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,480
up great areas to this to see where the morality 
can slip it doesn't ever slip you're never going  

304
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,840
to wake up one day and think animal abuse is 
justified are you you're not gonna go back  

305
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,240
on your morals if you understand that this is 
wrong you're not gonna go back on child abuse  

306
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,640
you're not gonna wake up one day and think child 
abuse is okay i think today i'm comfortable with  

307
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,840
this idea i'm gonna do it today it's black and 
white it's always wrong and it's never justified  

308
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,000
another thing that vegans will focus way too 
much on when advocating for animal rights  

309
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,960
is being liked by the other person we think that 
being likable vegans is going to get people to  

310
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,080
take veganism seriously raise your hand if 
you've fallen into this trap i know i have  

311
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,960
thank you for being honest because we don't want 
to be the preachy vegan we don't want to be the  

312
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
pushy vegan we don't want to be the annoying 
vegan we don't want to be the vegan that turns  

313
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,040
people off veganism here's the thing non-vegans 
have been trying to bully us psychologically  

314
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,720
into this thinking and you need to realize that 
and you know better this is just manipulation  

315
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,000
people are trying to make you feel insecure about 
this because they're shooting down the messenger  

316
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,360
because they don't want to take the message 
seriously and face it when we play into this  

317
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:19,840
they win when i say they the abusers and the 
animals lose it's a flaw to care about being liked  

318
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,840
more than what you're saying and the rights 
of these animals the rights of these beings  

319
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,600
in no other situation do we actually use 
this line of thinking so we're actually  

320
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,840
being hypocrites here you probably noticed 
that people actually like people who don't  

321
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,320
really care what other people think of them when 
you don't care what other people think of you  

322
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,440
and to the contrary when you care so 
much about what other people think of you  

323
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
people actually don't like that they don't like 
that about you because it comes off as a weakness  

324
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,760
and i actually think that telling people the 
truth is the best way to achieve this anyway  

325
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,880
so it's counterproductive if you want to be liked 
then do things that are deserving of being liked  

326
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,920
and this shouldn't be your goal being life 
shouldn't be your goal because if somebody  

327
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,280
likes you and goes vegan for that reason 
what happens when they don't like you anymore

328
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,160
which will happen

329
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
imagine civil rights activists 
focusing on being liked by white people  

330
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,800
in order for them to take black rights 
seriously how weird would that be trying to be  

331
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
accommodating in whichever way socially to have 
them taking black rights seriously it would be  

332
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,120
insane to even witness that happening and this is 
also a tool that you should use in your advocacy  

333
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,560
to make sure that you're in line with what you're 
supposed to be doing here as an activist if you  

334
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,760
ever feel like questioning what you're 
doing compare it to any other injustice  

335
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
would you be advocating this way in 
any other case for any other injustice  

336
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,840
if not don't do it here animals deserve 
way better from us when we first started av

337
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
i noticed that the outreach that 
we were doing on the streets  

338
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,760
i noticed that there was a lot of 
things that i learned in my previous  

339
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,000
work experience in doing sales all 
the sales training that i had received  

340
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,760
there were things in that that i could carry 
over into outreach that were applicable here  

341
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
and so if you go on our website it says we use 
a value-based sales approach i want to explain  

342
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,960
what that means because i think there's been 
a bit of a confusion about this i definitely  

343
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,840
don't mean the kind of sales that we're 
commonly used to and that we commonly know  

344
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,360
i'm talking about certain aspects of sales that 
are applicable here because at the end of the day  

345
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,200
what we're doing is trying to convince somebody 
of something they're not already convinced on  

346
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,640
and that's what sales is really i'm trying to 
convince you right now to apply this approach when  

347
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,680
you're doing outreach and that's why i brought 
this into this equation but i want to explain  

348
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,360
that i really do not mean schmoozing people and 
telling people what you think they want to hear  

349
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:25,920
and using hooks like psychological hooks to trick 
them into signing on the dotted line that's not  

350
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,760
how this works at all activism is a different 
ballpark to sales one of the traditional things  

351
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,280
that occurs in sales is the three-step process for 
any sale so i'll talk you through that right now  

352
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,320
the three-step process is really simple 
the first step is all right i'm gonna

353
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,600
okay i'm gonna pause right here because this 
is the part where i find that there's the most  

354
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,280
confusion and it's the whole sales message so yes 
i'm going to break down this three-step process  

355
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:04,240
but the only reason i'm doing that here is to 
show you where sales tools and really they're  

356
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,720
not sales tools they're communication tools but 
where these communication tools are applicable  

357
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,560
from the sales world into activism but again i 
need to reiterate this i said this in the video  

358
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,920
sales is not activism just because you 
have x number of sales years of sales  

359
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,160
experience doesn't mean you have x number of years 
experience in activism that's not how this works  

360
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,800
at all it just means that you've learned a 
few things about communication that might  

361
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,720
might be applicable here in activism i found 
in fact when i go over all of the sales  

362
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,120
things i've ever learned that most of it is 
actually unapplicable unequivocally unapplicable  

363
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,320
and that's because the the goal in sales is 
usually to get someone to sign on the dotted  

364
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,440
line and there's usually a financial incentive 
here where and i named it the value-based sales  

365
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,120
approach from the very beginning in 2016 
when we started av for the purpose of  

366
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:16,400
setting it apart from sales in general the common 
view of sales this is a new i was trying to create  

367
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,080
something new here where we can carry over what 
is applicable and what i've found the deeper i've  

368
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,440
gone into this is that a very minimal amount is 
actually applicable from the sales world over here  

369
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,080
so with that added commentary on this bit 
i will now continue for you guys to get  

370
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,760
somebody convicted in what it is that 
you're trying to convince them of  

371
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,080
we have all of the lodge process up to sales one 
of the traditional things that occurs in sales is  

372
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:52,560
the three-step process for any sale so i'll talk 
you through that right now the three-step process  

373
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,280
is really simple the first step is to get 
somebody convicted in what it is that you're  

374
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,800
trying to convince them of we have all the logic 
all of the reason on our side and it's important  

375
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,920
to use logic and reason i'm not saying don't use 
that but if you don't get somebody emotionally  

376
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,160
convicted in this issue because it's a justice 
issue then don't expect a shift from anybody  

377
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,240
that's why i don't like these philosophical 
discussions that we have with people about  

378
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,160
veganism we have these what seems to be like a bar 
discussion just food for thought and that's a real  

379
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,160
issue because that's not what this is supposed to 
be about this is an accountability conversation  

380
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,760
and that first step is best achieved when you 
connect them to the sense of injustice and you  

381
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
hold them accountable to that injustice 
the second step is to make sure that they  

382
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,080
understand that they as an individual are 
responsible that they're in the hot seat  

383
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,760
this isn't something they can just palm off to 
the government or palm off to these industries and  

384
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,240
say we need to focus on petitioning against these 
industries this is about them as an individual and  

385
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,320
you can't let them get out of that that's your job 
meat doesn't just harm yourself it harms someone  

386
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,960
else someone or something do you think an animal 
is a thing oh okay i'll see where you're going  

387
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,440
but like let's but that's the problem that's 
going to be your that's going to be the club  

388
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,640
the lack of compassion for non-human um you know 
that's going to be your problem but what about  

389
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,960
you because i'm talking to you right now do you 
have a lack of compassion for non-human animals  

390
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,480
so are you against animal exploitation yes i am 
okay so what do you think you can do about it

391
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,800
yeah we're talking yeah i will share 
this conversation with my family  

392
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,120
what do you think you will do 
though yeah i will start more

393
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,400
the third step once you have achieved that 
second step through dealing with their objections  

394
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,080
anchoring it back to accountability once they 
concede you move on to the third step which is  

395
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,880
tying in the benefits everybody loves to know 
what's in it for them right because humans are  

396
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:21,200
selfish right okay so the number one benefit 
for you going vegan obviously for the animals  

397
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,720
it's that they no longer have to be tortured 
and abused by you but the benefit for you  

398
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,400
is that you no longer have to abuse them 
and therefore you're no longer a hypocrite  

399
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
because you say that you're against animal 
abuse in fact in that very conversation  

400
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,680
they said that that they're against animal 
abuse right that's the only reason we're  

401
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,400
vegan today why you guys are sitting here right 
now trying to learn about outreach is because  

402
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
you hate the hypocrisy don't you you would never 
want to live with that hypocrisy again would you  

403
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,120
more importantly would never want to abuse animals  

404
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,240
anymore would you i used to say if you do this 
correctly you eat a whole foods plant-based diet  

405
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,640
you will actually get the health benefits from 
doing this as well and i used to say that it's  

406
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,760
better for the environment if you do this as a 
benefit you have a lower footprint it's a mistake  

407
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,840
because i'm conflating animal rights with 
environmentalism and with human health

408
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,560
i know that it's going to be tempting for you to 
do this even after this workshop you're going to  

409
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,840
be very tempted to go there still i i you only 
know whether this is true if you apply this  

410
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,800
but if i can save you some time it's a 
mistake focus on why as opposed to how  

411
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,840
way more focus on why how is so eat i 
mean it's so easy to go vegan all right

412
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,400
so i just want to add some commentary there 
to that piece that i just shared with you  

413
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,800
guys and i'm not sure if i made this clear in 
that last piece of commentary i offered but  

414
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,720
that three-step process is not something you 
necessarily need to follow at the cubes i'm just  

415
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,840
breaking that down to explain the traditional 
sales process and how it can be like how it's  

416
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,280
applicable here and how we usually get people you 
know what the process is to get them to that point  

417
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,760
of taking veganism seriously but i'm going to 
break down the process for you at the end of this  

418
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:34,800
in in slides so i'm gonna break it down for you 
even more um simpler and make it more clearer for  

419
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,600
you guys so just stick around for that at the end 
after this presentation is complete so i just want  

420
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,720
to clarify i'm not asking you to do the three-step 
process at the cubes that's not what we're asking  

421
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,200
you to do we're just explaining the three-step 
process and showing you how this one little thing  

422
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,680
in sales is actually something that we can learn 
from and apply some of that here in activism  

423
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,600
in this day and age do we really think it's 
difficult for people like we create our  

424
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,520
way more focus on if you apply how is 
so eat i mean it's so easy to go vegan  

425
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:20,160
it's a mistake focus on why as opposed to 
how way more focus on why how is so eat  

426
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,440
i mean it's so easy to go vegan in this day and 
age do we really think it's difficult for people  

427
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
like we create all these programs and recipes and 
we try to make sure people have all the support  

428
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,240
in the world is it really that difficult though 
aren't we babying people aren't we coddling people  

429
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,520
because if you're convinced on why you need to 
be vegan you just need to go and use google in  

430
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,120
2020 we have the internet you can use google and 
ask any question there is about any ingredients  

431
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,520
about any recipe any product and you'll find out 
pretty quickly if it's vegan or not and that's the  

432
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,120
only compass you need to be vegan is this vegan 
or is this not there's two types of people in  

433
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,400
the world those who say being vegan is easy those 
who say being vegan is hard those who say being  

434
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,120
vegan is easier focus on the victims those who 
say being vegan is hard to focus on themselves  

435
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,280
so whenever they bring up that distraction 
oh i don't know how i could do this  

436
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,600
how whatever form of how that comes 
up how is completely a distraction  

437
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,680
if they're sold on why how is easy plus we 
give them a card anyway so they get support  

438
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,920
they get whatever they need at the end so 
don't focus on how another good question

439
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,720
i just want to let you guys know also we 
updated our resource page in our cards so when  

440
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,360
you're so when you're at the end of the 
interaction and you hand over a card  

441
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:56,960
it it's now updated and it says will you stop 
um what does it say will you stop being a human  

442
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,200
supremacist this was just updated and it has 
our website cubeoftruth.com and that link now  

443
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,760
takes you to our resources page so it's a lot 
more simple i'm really proud of this new update  

444
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,120
and if you go over to our resources page we've 
updated that as well to make that even simpler  

445
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,080
specifically the video section we've now put up a 
video that is the best of the best gary yourofsky  

446
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,960
moments in speeches and other other content 
he's put up mainly his speeches but we've  

447
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,760
put the best of the best of gary yourofsky 
all in one video and it's about three hours  

448
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:39,680
so that's pretty cool because if they need 
further convincing that's the video we're  

449
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,680
still going to keep the georgia tech speech up 
there the best speech you'll ever hear because  

450
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,680
it has all of the translations available and i 
think it covers like 30 languages or something so  

451
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,840
that's important we need to keep that up there 
for that reason but this other one that's up  

452
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,800
there you can play using the caption feature on 
youtube so it may still translate through that  

453
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,320
i don't well yeah i don't know how that works in 
other countries or if it just creates a caption  

454
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:16,240
in in english um yeah i'm not sure how that works 
but anyways we have that three-hour video for at  

455
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,480
least the english-speaking people of the world and 
uh that's pretty cool so let's get back into this  

456
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,600
is it's we give them a card anyway so they get 
support they get whatever they need at the end  

457
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,640
so don't focus on health another good question 
is when you're tying in the benefit at the end  

458
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,640
of that three-step process to ask the question 
do you think it's possible to be against this  

459
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,880
to be against what you're saying you're against 
while also supporting it and it's a good question  

460
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,600
to just tie in hypocrisy again and also to tie 
in the fact that there is no way around this  

461
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:00,720
there's no alternative you're either an animal 
abuser or you're not another thing i want to say  

462
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,480
about this approach that i'm teaching you right 
now is that this is way more satisfying to do  

463
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,000
than all these other approaches that involve 
pandering and compromising on the message  

464
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,680
and focusing on being liked and all this stuff 
this is way more satisfying i've noticed that  

465
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,520
over the last four years there was a huge surge 
in 2017 2018 for street outreach in our network  

466
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,280
and then it sort of dropped and i feel like people 
have lost interest in doing outreach they don't  

467
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,200
really see the benefits and how successful 
it is and they're not really convinced on how  

468
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,960
effective it is anymore when you're doing this 
approach you'll come to learn that all of your  

469
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,160
interactions are successful even if the individual 
doesn't say that they're going to go vegan  

470
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,400
you've at least told them what they need to hear 
which is probably the only time they're going to  

471
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,880
hear it and when you have that perspective every 
interaction is successful because again we're  

472
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,080
mediums of truth we speak for the animals in the 
same way that we would want to be spoken for if  

473
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,680
we were in their position we have a rule that 
we only talk to people who stop at the cube and  

474
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,320
that's because we want to talk to people who are 
open-minded and we also have an opening question  

475
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,400
that we ask would you like to know why we're here 
because we need a commitment from them so that  

476
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,040
this is a two-way conversation so you shouldn't 
be talking to people who are obviously unreachable  

477
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,480
but at the end there they don't say they're going 
vegan then there's no reason for you to think that  

478
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,960
wasn't a successful interaction so many times 
people don't even say anything affirmative to  

479
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,480
the outreacher and they become vegan this happens 
so often now we had someone at the melbourne  

480
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,200
workshop who was sitting and learning who said 
i don't think that the outreacher who got me to  

481
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,800
go vegan at a cube a year ago in melbourne even 
knows that i went vegan because i argued with the  

482
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,480
outreacher and walked off that's another reason 
why we've removed the tallies but i'll talk a  

483
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,400
little bit about that at the end who here has not 
heard about socratic questioning raise your hand

484
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,960
alright fair few of you this has been 
blown out of proportion a little bit too  

485
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,320
socratic questioning is a tool and it's a very 
good tool but it is only a tool it should be  

486
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,920
used within your interaction wherever you see fit 
wherever it's supposed to be used because asking  

487
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,720
questions is always a good idea it's always a 
good way of gathering information from the person  

488
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,600
to see where they're at psychologically when it 
comes to this but don't just use it throughout  

489
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,920
the whole interaction don't just ask question 
after question after question there's gonna be  

490
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:48,160
many times during the interaction where they give 
you the flaw to speak and lecturing them in that  

491
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,840
moment is actually the right way to go the reason 
why socratic questioning is there is because  

492
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,640
um so when i say giving you the like they're not 
necessarily giving you the flaw it's just a part  

493
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,040
in the a moment in the interaction where they're 
not saying anything and it would be completely  

494
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,400
appropriate for you to say something and to 
make a statement at that point because and i'm  

495
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,240
gonna break this down a little bit later when 
i do the slides because at that point when you  

496
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,920
make a statement or a closed-ended question or 
you don't even ask a question at all at that point  

497
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,680
what you're doing is pushing the conversation 
forward and that's necessary sometimes i'll break  

498
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,680
this down a little bit more detail like i said 
but i just wanted to add that commentary let's get  

499
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:39,040
back to it because we we wanna they give you the 
flaw to speak and lecturing them in that moment  

500
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,120
is actually the right way to go the reason why 
socratic questioning is there is because we want  

501
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:52,320
to ask questions instead of make statements but it 
doesn't mean that making statements is a bad idea

502
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,520
so i know that after i teach you guys this 
stuff it's just human nature that you will  

503
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,720
take this approach you'll apply your 
personality to it which i want you to do  

504
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,240
but then what i don't want you to do is 
butcher the approach itself and start  

505
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,040
saying things differently to how i'm suggesting 
that you say it so one little example is  

506
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,360
we say we a lot when we're talking about 
non-vegans and what they do to animals  

507
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:32,480
we're not in that situation anymore so this is 
pandering when we say the way we kill animals or  

508
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,840
why do we do this to them you're not doing this to 
them anymore so keep it accurate again apply apply  

509
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,240
your personality by all means but just keep 
it accurate and listen to what you're saying  

510
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,640
you should make it very clear that the individual 
you're speaking to needs to be held to account  

511
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,680
not you i think i get why we've been focusing 
on being liked more than promoting the message  

512
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,840
at hand here and it's because the defensiveness 
that we see coming from non-vegans i think is  

513
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:09,920
more profound more astounding than perhaps any 
of the defensiveness that we see in any other  

514
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,760
group of culprits of perpetrators in the world 
and i want to try to explain why i think that is  

515
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,640
when it comes to eating it's the most intimate 
connection we have with the outside world  

516
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,960
this is why we see people getting a lot more 
cognitively dissonant and defensive over the food  

517
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,640
aspect of veganism as opposed to the clothing 
aspects or the testing aspects of veganism  

518
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,240
more people are willing to accept that wearing 
fur is evil but when it comes to changing their  

519
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,680
eating habits their defensiveness is truly 
astounding this is what i experienced when i  

520
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,320
was promoting a plant-based diet for almost two 
years before i became an animal rights activist  

521
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,000
so when you couple that with the fact that we 
are addressing the largest and longest-standing  

522
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,080
injustice with the most pressing issue of our 
time and the fact that this is the most intimate  

523
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:08,640
connection people have with the outside world 
then you have to expect a nightmare i'm only going  

524
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,120
to mention this one objection when people say i 
only eat meat once in a while have you heard that  

525
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,320
they only say this to vegans and this only happens 
when they have a vegan in their environment  

526
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,840
again this is just to prove to you how obvious 
this is how obviously guilty people feel  

527
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,640
it doesn't even take long for people 
to say that to a vegan i don't eat meat  

528
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,560
that much anyway i'm trying to eat less 
and less meat to not participate today  

529
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:45,840
i'm i ate a lot of meat before so i'm trying 
to eat less it's hard to go really no meat for  

530
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:53,840
me but i'm trying to do less and less so i'm 
not participating in those games i lower my  

531
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,600
i don't cook food anymore i don't cook meat 
anymore but if i go to restaurants sometimes  

532
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:09,120
i order meats okay yeah i'm not full vegan 
myself but i try to at least five days a week  

533
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,000
why are you saying that

534
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,320
you wouldn't say that to your non-vegan friends  

535
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,840
and it's as black and white as that you know 
you're only a little bit of an animal abuser

536
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,280
again they would never do this with any other 
injustice they'd never be a little bit of a  

537
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,840
child abuser the word speciesism the words 
veganism and the word animal exploitation  

538
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,320
and carnism as well carnist people 
don't really understand these words  

539
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,160
it doesn't really hit the way that we want them 
to hit i'm not saying don't use these words  

540
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,080
i say vegan all the time but i want you 
to focus way more on what these words mean  

541
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,800
and use words like human supremacism 
because that clearly explains speciesism  

542
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,880
and it clearly explains what being a non-vegan 
is all about human supremacism and in terms of  

543
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,560
exploitation i think people think of 
sweatshop workers and i don't know they  

544
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,840
think of exploitation the music industry in the 
porn industry they don't really think of the  

545
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,240
animals being hacked apart having the children 
taken away from them the most torturous things  

546
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,720
imaginable happening to these innocent beings 
i don't really think of exploitation like that  

547
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:38,000
so it is exploitation but the better word to 
use here is animal abuse and human supremacism  

548
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,160
statistics a lot of the times we feel the 
need to bring up statistics you know 50 of  

549
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,760
the world's crops are used to you know 3 trillion 
animals are slaughtered every year by all means  

550
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,560
do this but please keep this to an absolute 
minimum because we're not supposed to be  

551
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,400
highly educated and academic and it doesn't 
need to be in order for people to take this  

552
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,680
very simple issue seriously animal abuse is 
wrong and there's no justification for it  

553
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,520
we don't need statistics to prove that to people 
necessarily if people want to talk about this to  

554
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,760
you and they bring up statistics and they want 
to debate statistics make sure that you're not  

555
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,960
feeding into the distraction too much i 
want to talk about vegetarianism real quick  

556
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,440
i think vegetarianism is a cancer 
to the animal rights movement  

557
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,920
and we think that for some reason in this 
movement we think that vegetarians are closer  

558
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:45,040
to this message they're our allies again we would 
never do this with i just wanna i just wanna take  

559
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:51,520
a moment to call myself out this is the holding 
non-vegans accountable 2.0 workshop but i'm going  

560
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,040
to take a sweet moment to hold myself accountable 
because i just said in this movement we think  

561
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,680
that vegetarians are the same whatever i said i 
don't think that anymore in fact i've probably  

562
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,240
been the most vocal about this in the animal 
rights movement but yeah i was just talking  

563
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,720
about how we need to be accurate with our words so 
i just want to pull myself up there and say that  

564
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:23,840
i no longer talk like this about vegeta i never 
really did ever so yeah any other injustice and  

565
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,840
you and they bring up statistics animal abuse 
is wrong and there's no justification for it  

566
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,080
make sure that you're not feeding into the 
distraction too much i want to talk about  

567
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:43,600
vegetarianism real quick i think vegetarianism 
is a cancer to the animal rights movement and  

568
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:49,600
we think that for some reason in this movement we 
think that vegetarians are closer to this message  

569
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:57,600
they're our allies again we would never do this 
with any other injustice and vegetarian is no  

570
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:06,880
different to paleo i mean vegetarians will stop 
eating meat then that's no different to what the  

571
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,840
paleo crew are doing because they don't eat dairy 
and it's been argued that the dairy industry could  

572
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,840
be the cruelest industry in the world we should 
really be calling the paleo crew our allies

573
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,920
not vegetarians but do you see how insane 
that sounds me even saying that we would call  

574
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:35,360
the paleo guys our allies just because meat is 
obviously cruel to animals it doesn't mean dairy  

575
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,040
isn't and eggs isn't and you all know that because 
you're vegan and you already know this information  

576
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:48,080
but when we even slightly give in to this 
idea that vegetarians are on our side then  

577
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,320
we perpetuate this myth even further we are the 
ones who are spreading the wrong message here  

578
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,880
so when someone says don't worry i'm 
vegetarian you don't need to talk to me  

579
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,720
your response should be you're actually our 
target market and in fact you have more of a  

580
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,000
responsibility to go harder on those individuals 
because they already think they're doing enough  

581
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,280
they feel entitled and how dare you tell them 
they're doing any different is the attitude  

582
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,600
they usually give you i appreciate all that 
you're doing just once you know that i'm a  

583
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,960
vegetarian that drinks almond milk okay that's 
good local farm interesting i'm just saying like  

584
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,200
you might want to just focus your food versus 
somewhere else because i i totally am already  

585
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,520
on board i got that so was animal cruelty 
one of the reasons why you became vegetarian  

586
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,760
since i was 19 i'm 45 okay that's about 27 years 
of vegetarian one of the footage that we chose  

587
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,200
here is also from local like free range like egg 
farms let me ask you a question because you say  

588
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,880
that you usually get your eggs from like local 
like free range farms where did they get their  

589
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:59,040
hands from like for example her father's chickens 
that run around his yard so like they are i don't  

590
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:04,240
know where he gets attention because um what sex 
is important in the egg industry males are females  

591
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:11,840
obviously the females so when people get hence 
they get them from a breeder in hatcheries even  

592
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,120
like for people that just want to get like 
a egg laying hence males and females are  

593
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,880
born a different color if you're born female 
you're thrown to the left if you're a male  

594
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,200
you're thrown to the right where do you think 
the males go i get it directly into a blender

595
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,040
so i'm doing everything i can to 
minimize my impact but i'm not good  

596
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,160
would you consider animal cruelty to be an 
injustice yes yeah would you take that same  

597
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,160
stance with any other injustice because you do 
recognize that there is cruelty and eggs right  

598
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:52,800
sure so i found with the majority of vegetarians 
actually they're harder to get through they're not  

599
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,400
our allies they're not closest to this message 
they're pompous sure there's vegetarians out  

600
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,520
there who didn't know better and i've met many 
of those too they just didn't know better once  

601
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,120
you tell them they go vegan on the spot 
that's the dream circumstance but i'm  

602
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,000
saying most people are not like this if they're 
vegetarian imagine if all vegetarians were vegan  

603
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,360
the percentage of vegetarians is always way 
larger than the percentage of vegans when  

604
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,480
they do those statistics imagine if all the 
vegetarians were outreached effectively and  

605
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,600
they went vegan we would have way more vegans 
on our side also when people at the end of your  

606
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,880
outreach will say i'm gonna try to do better 
i'll try i'm gonna try to go vegan please  

607
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:42,400
do not use the word try and do not let people 
use the word try would you try to be a non-racist  

608
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,720
would you try not to be a child 
abuser or would you just [ __ ] stop  

609
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,280
once you realize that it's wrong again 
don't let them off the hook let them  

610
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,640
know that there is a moral imperative here 
when someone says i'm gonna try what i say  

611
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:05,600
in order to get them to rid themselves of this try 
nonsense is to compare it to any other injustice  

612
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,320
like i just compared it to child abuse and 
racism etc would you say that you would try  

613
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,840
or would you just stop and that usually 
corrects that for people very quickly

614
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:30,080
um i'm going to get into this a little bit more 
later but i want to add this piece in here and say  

615
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,800
that we have had another update to this section  

616
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,000
we're constantly seeking to improve here 
guys we're constantly making software updates  

617
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,840
and one of them is this one here when we 
compare to other injustices we've actually found  

618
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:54,000
see okay so my analysis on this is that 
human beings only truly care about themselves

619
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:04,560
that's it so when we say child abuse racism 
sexism feminism whatever it is we're relying  

620
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,480
upon how much they care about those issues and 
if they're not an activist when it comes to those  

621
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,480
issues we shouldn't expect that they care 
a great deal about those issues should we  

622
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:24,880
so we've found that the most effective thing to do 
in all situations is in fact hold them accountable  

623
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,160
to themselves so in other words instead of 
comparing it to an injustice that involves  

624
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:38,320
other groups of humans how about you just ask them 
about themselves how would you feel if someone  

625
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:47,280
was torturing you enslaving you and was going to 
murder you and the excuse your oppressors used was  

626
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,680
i'm trying to do less of it i'm only going to cut 
they say they're only going to cut your leg off  

627
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,760
uh you're probably gonna die from a doe 
so is that better than not killing i mean  

628
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,200
you know it's essentially putting them in the 
victim's position and saying what if someone was  

629
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,560
to enslave torture and murder you less but 
never ever liberate you from your oppression  

630
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,400
how would you feel would you want to 
be liberated if you were the victim  

631
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,840
or would you want these nonsense baby 
steps that don't really go anywhere  

632
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,920
so when you're comparing to other groups of humans 
it might be most effective for you to in fact  

633
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,120
according to our latest update and my 
analysis on this is that if you just  

634
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:42,880
rely on the fact that human beings truly only care 
about themselves uh more than more they at least  

635
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,640
care more about themselves than than anything 
else any other group of humans and i'm speaking  

636
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:55,360
generally for most people here this is why i'm 
trying to get deep into what is the most effective  

637
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,160
because there is no perfect approach for every 
single individual on the planet that doesn't exist  

638
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:07,120
what i can only teach you is most effective 
for most people and i'm going to continue  

639
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,480
to expand that and improve on that as 
much as possible let's get back into it

640
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,400
would you say that you would try or would you just 
stop and that usually corrects that for people  

641
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:29,200
very quickly i want to try to be better 
there's no trying when it comes to justice  

642
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:36,240
you can't try to be non-racist you're either 
non-racist or you're a racist and i say that  

643
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,800
comparison because you understand injustice 
in that context but justice is justice  

644
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,840
what's evil is evil you can't have it both ways 
what's right is right what's wrong is wrong so  

645
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,000
don't try you have to do it do you think 
you'll go vegan um i can definitely try yeah  

646
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,000
wow i love my family here but i can stop i can 
spread it through my family make sure that they  

647
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,800
eat less now i'm just going to leave you with 
this to think about because you said try would  

648
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,240
we say that with any other injustice would we try 
to not be a child abuser or would we just do it

649
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,480
yeah so please don't compromise on this injustice 
because the animals suffer as a result of that  

650
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,800
you really just need to get out there and do 
this and see how effective it is for yourself  

651
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,920
that one guy he was talking to so anyone 
can do this and i highly recommend it and  

652
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:41,120
the tallies as you know we've removed our tallies 
we used to try and measure how effective we are  

653
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,800
and that was the reason why we had the tally 
there we tried to have some kind of metric  

654
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:53,600
that we wanted to use to show that these events 
this form of street outreach is really effective  

655
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,240
but the mistake that we made is that you can't 
really tell if someone is going to go vegan or not  

656
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,120
you just have to speak for the animals in 
the way that you would want to be spoken for  

657
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,760
if you're in their position say the correct 
things and that's a successful conversation and  

658
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,760
a lot of the times people say they're going to 
go vegan and while that's still a good thing i'm  

659
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,520
not saying that's not a good indication if someone 
says they're going to go vegan they may very well  

660
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,560
stick to that but i actually have examples of many 
cases of people saying they're going vegan after  

661
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:33,760
listening to me and they do not go vegan you don't 
know what's going on in people's minds and what's  

662
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,160
going on in their hearts and what they're going 
to experience after they've talked to you you  

663
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,200
don't know if they're going to continue arguing 
with their friends about what you've talked to  

664
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:47,040
them about and then that leading to them going 
vegan because all of their friends made stupid  

665
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,560
comments and one of their friend held them to 
account again and that rang in their head and  

666
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,360
they were thinking about it for a week and they 
couldn't let it go and then finally they conceded  

667
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,760
to the hypocrisy and they became vegan you 
just don't know you don't know the process  

668
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,320
another thing is that hypocrisy i just want to 
go back to that real quick it's the reason why  

669
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,000
each of us went vegan for sure there's a story 
that i have on my youtube of gary yourofsky  

670
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,240
i was in the car with him he was 
telling this really awesome story that

671
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:28,000
all right okay guys i want you to pay attention 
to this point i'm making here because i only  

672
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,160
realized how powerful and significant this 
point was when i watched this workshop back  

673
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:42,320
what i have successfully pointed out here 
is well you'll hear my point in a moment but  

674
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:49,200
this is so tremendously profound and i really want 
you to understand what i'm saying here but it's a  

675
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,360
story about gary and i haven't even pointed this 
out to gary yet but i'm going to do so soon but  

676
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,520
one thing i learned from him is that he didn't go 
vegan because of that elephant in the circus and  

677
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,760
he didn't go vegan because of the pigs that he saw 
being tortured and murdered at thorn apple valley  

678
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:13,520
um pig pig slaughterhouse the pig sloth house 
there so that's the story he's told the world  

679
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,840
and i believe that that's what he felt was 
the catalyst for a long time but when i was  

680
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:26,240
chilling with him in detroit he told me a story 
which i recorded and i put up on my youtube  

681
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:35,280
and that story he tells a new story about how he 
went vegan and what was really the catalyst to  

682
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:43,280
change him and it's really powerful if you want 
to understand what it takes to truly get people  

683
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,640
to go vegan because if we can understand how 
the best activists in the world have gone vegan  

684
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,040
then that's a pretty good indicator because that's 
what we're trying to shoot for here not just  

685
01:13:53,040 --> 01:14:00,320
people to go vegan but we need people to speak up 
and to be effective when they speak up and let's  

686
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,360
look at how activists went vegan that's a great 
thing to observe and learn from so without further  

687
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:12,720
ado please pay attention one of their friend held 
them to account again and that rang in their head  

688
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,040
and they were thinking about it for a week and 
they couldn't let it go and then finally they  

689
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:22,000
conceded to the hypocrisy and they became vegan 
you just don't know you don't know the process  

690
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,560
another thing is that hypocrisy i just want to 
go back to that real quick it's the reason why  

691
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,320
each of us went vegan for sure there's a story 
that i have on my youtube of gary yourofsky  

692
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,920
i was in the car with him he was telling this 
really awesome story that i'd never heard before  

693
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:47,920
about how a hockey team in detroit used to throw 
octopuses onto the ice and he was an animal rights  

694
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,560
guy at the time every time someone would score 
a goal they would do this and he was an animal  

695
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,440
rights guy at the time who was protesting this 
and he called a radio station and he started  

696
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,520
saying what's next are we going to have all these 
other teams with sharks and lions and their names  

697
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,760
also throwing those animals onto the ice every 
time they score a goal and he was going nuts  

698
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,600
and then the radio guy said whoa gary chill 
chill what did you have for dinner last night  

699
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,080
and then gary was like a salad

700
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,880
and it was that moment that he realized that no 
other answer could have been acceptable and the  

701
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:31,280
hypocrisy was what got gary yourofsky to go vegan 
that night he said was the night that he went  

702
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:37,280
vegan i heard stories about the elephant story 
in michigan he talked about a circus incident and  

703
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,520
then there was this other incident but it wasn't 
that he was going to thorn apple valley pig farm  

704
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,560
in in michigan and seeing pigs being slaughtered 
every day he kept going and witnessing he couldn't  

705
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:54,880
believe that this was going on he hadn't gone 
vegan until that guy said you're a hypocrite

706
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:05,120
so please understand how powerful that is even the 
best activists that we know of the most effective  

707
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,760
this is what caused them to go vegan it's 
the same thing for me it's the same exact  

708
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,400
story for me when i realized from listening to 
gary that i was a hypocrite if i wasn't vegan  

709
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:22,320
and there's no way you can justify 
even a little bit of animal consumption  

710
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,840
that's when i became vegan but prior to that i 
was bullshitting i was plant-based i would eat  

711
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,080
salmon sometimes i'd wear leather i was 
raw vegan while wearing leather jackets  

712
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,520
i could take you through a typical interaction 
if you'd like from start to end would you like  

713
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,560
that yeah yep so we start the conversation 
by would you like to know why we're here  

714
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,560
they need to say something affirmative for the 
conversation to go ahead they either say yes or  

715
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,960
they try to guess and that's an affirmative answer 
so you continue yes what we're doing here is we're  

716
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,760
showing the standard practice footage of what 
happens in the meat dairy in egg industries and  

717
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:09,040
other industries that abuse animals and we're also 
showing free-range grass-fed organic cage-free  

718
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:16,080
humane certified hey guys would you like to know 
why we're here i'm guessing against animal cruelty  

719
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:22,800
that is a good guess what we're showing on 
the screens is the animal industries meat  

720
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,400
dairy and eggs and other industries also that 
abuse animals for products would you like to  

721
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,000
hear what we're doing here um sure cool yes what 
we're doing is we're showing the behind the scenes  

722
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,920
of industries that abuse animals so this is in 
the meat industry dairy industry egg industry  

723
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,800
we're showing is also the best of the best so 
this is free range cage free humane certified  

724
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,720
all right would you like to hear what we're doing 
here yes what we're doing is we're showing the  

725
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:58,640
behind the scenes of industries that abuse animals 
like meat dairy eggs leather the next question you  

726
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:05,360
have to ask them is how do you feel about animal 
abuse usually they say well it's obviously wrong  

727
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:11,360
100 against it that's what they usually say 
people say okay so you think this is wrong  

728
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,600
would you say this is evil this is me doubling 
down to make sure i've owned them on this point  

729
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:22,880
would you say this is evil would you say that 
this is evil yes treating animals like our slaves  

730
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:30,000
yeah would you say that stabbing animals to 
death for a sandwich is wrong yeah yeah yeah  

731
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,040
that's hard what are your initial thoughts how 
does this kind of stuff make you guys feel guilty

732
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,160
yeah so it's safe to say that you guys are 
against animal abuse yeah for sure i want you  

733
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,400
all right i just want to clarify that again there 
was an update here that we've made um i don't  

734
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,360
think that closed-ended questions are actually as 
effective as open-ended questions in this segment  

735
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,920
of the interaction so instead of saying do you 
think stabbing an animal to death for a sandwich  

736
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,800
or torturing animals to death is evil 
do you think that's evil do you think  

737
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,680
that's wrong it's a closed-ended 
question it's an obvious question  

738
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:16,800
it's in fact more important for you to say how do 
you feel about animal abuse and then when they say  

739
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:24,320
i feel guilty i feel horrible it's terrible and 
then the next thing you need to do to just confirm  

740
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,520
their position on animal abuse is to say is it 
safe to say that you are against animal abuse  

741
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,840
and in in some circumstances i might even 
triple down and say would you say it's evil  

742
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,520
so you need to ask that open-ended question 
first and then the closed-ended question  

743
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,280
just to confirm and seal it off now 
that will make sense why you need to  

744
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,840
do that as i continue on with the approach 
here showing you the step-by-step process

745
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,680
the footage how does it make you feel it makes 
me cringe cringe why do you think it makes you  

746
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:04,320
feel that way because i love the animals you love 
animals interesting so safe to say you're against  

747
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:11,760
animal abuse animal cruelty yeah absolutely most 
people say yes absolutely now if they say no  

748
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:19,440
they're either drunk or trolling and either 
way you shouldn't be having a conversation  

749
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,160
with those people they're not reachable 
again this is so obviously wrong i mean  

750
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,840
you're seeing animals being hacked apart on 
the screens how could anybody say this is okay  

751
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,320
so usually they say that then the next step would 
be okay what do you think you can do about it as  

752
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,120
an individual so we've gone from the first step 
of the process within the three-step process of  

753
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,440
emotional conviction really quickly moving to 
the second step which is accountability what  

754
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,880
do you think you can do about it and again most 
of the time i actually get i think i could stop  

755
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,560
eating them i could become vegan so what do 
you think you can do about it as individuals  

756
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:01,040
stop become vegan yes we can vegan it's very 
simple isn't it yeah that's why i'm saying  

757
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:08,240
this is so [ __ ] obvious to people it's not that 
complex it's really not it's very obvious so the  

758
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,680
interaction so then you say what do you think 
you can do about this as an individual usually  

759
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,880
they say well i can stop being vegan but if they 
say something that a lot of the times they'll  

760
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,520
actually try to distract and say well you can 
protest the government protest these industries  

761
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,600
again you deal with the objection bring it 
back to accountability that's all you're doing  

762
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,240
deal with the objection anchor it back to 
accountability once you have the concede  

763
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,600
after dealing with all of those back and 
forth back and forth once you have them  

764
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,400
concede then you bring in the benefits do you 
know what the number one benefit is to be vegan  

765
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,120
usually their ears perk up when you say 
benefit and they look at you like what is it  

766
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,400
i want to know and that's when you say 
well obviously the benefit for them is  

767
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,160
they're no longer tortured and abused 
for you you're no longer the reason  

768
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,920
that this happens to them but the benefit for you 
is that you no longer have to be an animal abuser

769
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,680
right so a new update again and i'm gonna 
break this down in the slides that i do later  

770
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:18,080
but the update here is to 
say for the first time um  

771
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:26,000
you will have the opportunity to stop being a 
hypocrite instead of saying you will no longer  

772
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,880
be a hypocrite and i'm saying this because 
many vegans are straight-up hypocrites  

773
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,040
but when you become vegan it is the first 
time in human life you can stop you have the  

774
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:46,080
opportunity to stop being a hypocrite uh because 
you address the biggest hypocrisy i think humans  

775
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:54,240
are engaging in so i just want to clarify 
that it doesn't automatically remove you  

776
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,600
from hypocrisy when you become vegan but it does 
give you an opportunity to truly end hypocrisy  

777
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,160
and you no longer have to be hypocrite and abused 
for you you're no longer the reason that this  

778
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:12,160
happens to them but the benefit for you is that 
you no longer have to be an animal abuser and you  

779
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,800
no longer have to be a hypocrite because you say 
that you're against animal abuse do you guys know  

780
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:24,480
what the number one benefit is of not supporting 
what's on the screen from being vegan any guesses

781
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,440
so the number one benefit obviously 
for the animals once you're vegan  

782
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,440
then they're no longer tortured and abused 
because of you so they're relieved of that  

783
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:42,400
and then the best benefit for you guys is that 
because in the beginning of the conversation  

784
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,920
you stated that you're against animal abuse 
you're horrified by what's on the screens  

785
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,800
when you're vegan for the first time 
then you no longer have to be a hypocrite

786
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:03,040
never thought of it like that do you know the 
number one benefit of going vegan the number  

787
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,280
one benefit obviously for the animals once you're 
vegan then they're no longer tortured because of  

788
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:15,040
you so they're relieved of that and then the best 
benefit for you is that because you said you're  

789
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,560
against animal abuse when you're vegan for the 
first time you no longer have to be a hypocrite

790
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,680
and do you know the number one benefit when 
you stop supporting animals and be vegan the  

791
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:33,280
number one benefit of that you're not part of a 
crazy-ass society that's actually really close  

792
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:38,480
it would first be for the animals would no 
longer be abused by you but as an individual  

793
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,440
this is really important on an individual 
level since you've told me in this conversation  

794
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,840
that you are against animal abuse and you're 
clearly disturbed of what you see on the screen  

795
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,080
when you become vegan for the first time 
you no longer have to be a hypocrite  

796
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,160
do you know the number one benefit of being vegan 
like the number one benefit any guesses like  

797
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:07,840
health health so health is conditional you can 
absolutely receive some amazing health benefits  

798
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,440
depending on how you coordinate your lifestyle but 
the number one benefit would first of course be  

799
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:18,880
for the animals they would no longer be abused 
because of you but as individuals the number  

800
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:24,480
one benefit would be if you say you're against 
animal abuse and you look at these screens and  

801
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:31,680
you're disgusted by it then you no longer have to 
be a hypocrite it's really important that we don't  

802
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:37,200
just say have a nice day after telling them the 
benefit it's really important that you ask them  

803
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:42,160
what they're going to do that's how you should 
end the interaction so what do you think you'll do  

804
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,080
and when people say i'll try to do better then you 
tie in the fact that they shouldn't try they need  

805
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:52,480
to do and the best way to end it is so what do 
you think you'll do it's really important that  

806
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,360
you close off strongly because then it's like 
the whole interaction was for nothing if you  

807
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,680
don't close it off properly without that close it 
really like seals the whole conversation and they  

808
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,440
really understand what the imperative is they're 
after after seeing this footage after having  

809
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,200
this conversation what do you think you'll 
do moving forward regarding this suffering  

810
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,640
i mean something had to be done but

811
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,560
so like just right there when hudson said what 
do you think you'll do about this suffering  

812
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,360
i'm just going to add this on and i'm 
sure hudson will appreciate this because  

813
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:34,080
he always appreciates these little updates but 
he's absolutely killing it in these examples  

814
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:42,000
um the suffering that you cause the suffering 
that's happening because of you just a little  

815
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:50,880
added update that i would make there and 
i'll just go back this footage after having  

816
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,640
this conversation what do you think you'll 
do moving forward regarding this suffering  

817
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:03,840
i mean something had to be done but i 
don't know just keep in mind that until  

818
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,520
the day comes that you're vegan animals

819
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:18,080
so i guess i spoke too soon there 
because he ties in right here  

820
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,400
um that further accountability that i was looking 
to add into that comment he just made so let's  

821
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,880
just retract that comment i made because 
he really does double down at the end here  

822
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:36,400
to make sure that this is happening because of 
the individual so let's just continue our gonna  

823
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,280
are gonna be victimized something had to be done 
but i don't know just keep in mind that until  

824
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:51,280
the day comes that you're vegan animals are 
going to be victimized and abused because of you  

825
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,600
so just think about what side of history you 
want to stand on when it comes to stamping out  

826
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,720
this particular injustice what do you think you 
guys are going to do leaving here i feel like  

827
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,400
i'll i'll think more about it i feel like the 
next time i have me but whether they come vegan  

828
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,800
i don't want to see that in my future to be honest 
but i mean yeah just remember until the day that  

829
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,680
you do align those actions with the words that 
you said during this conversation that animals  

830
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:23,360
will be abused because of you so just decide what 
side of history you want to stand on what do you  

831
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,360
guys think you're going to do after seeing this 
footage i don't know i'm definitely going to try  

832
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:32,000
to be more conscious about it i don't know if 
i'm ready to fully be a vegan but i don't know

833
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,920
what i'll leave you guys with is that um 
you agree that when you're taking baby steps  

834
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,320
just keep in mind that for however long you are 
taking baby steps animals are going to be tortured  

835
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:54,640
for you guys so when you're ready to stop abusing 
animals and stop being hypocrites then you guys  

836
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,720
can be vegan so think about what side of history 
you guys want to stand on all right what do  

837
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,760
you think you're going to do leaving here we 
rethink my [ __ ] process in terms of what i eat  

838
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,840
for sure because i want to i want 
to be a better person again is

839
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,600
just understand that until the day that 
you do decide to align your actions  

840
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,720
with the beliefs that you said 
you've had during this conversation  

841
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,760
the animals will be abused because of you so just 
decide what side of history you want to stand on  

842
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,280
when stamping out this particular injustice now 
i know this seems confrontational you guys are

843
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,280
i just want to take a moment to give 
a quick shout out to jacob and hudson  

844
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:46,640
for those very fine examples they are killing it 
right now and really adopting this approach whoops

845
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,240
i hope the audio was okay there but just want 
to shout out to jacob and hudson they're doing  

846
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:59,680
great work you're thinking [ __ ] i don't know if 
i could just decide what side of history you want  

847
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:05,920
to stand on when stamping out this particular 
injustice now i know this seems confrontational  

848
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,560
you guys are probably thinking [ __ ] i 
don't know if i could say that to people but  

849
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,160
i'm telling you this is the most satisfying 
thing that you can say to somebody  

850
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,840
because it's effective because that is the most 
effective thing that you can say to somebody  

851
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:25,600
and again this has been applied i mean we've got 
a very keen student in the back here hudson do you  

852
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,440
want to tell people what kind of reactions you've 
had or if you've had any negative interactions  

853
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:35,840
yes at first i was really worried about it about 
this whole approach and paul was like no we gotta  

854
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,120
try it you gotta try it and then i went up to 
people who were twice my size hold up hold up  

855
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,360
start from the start when you didn't want to do 
this you thought that this was too aggressive  

856
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,240
yeah i thought it was way too aggressive i got 
brainwashed by the vegan movement and thought  

857
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:57,600
that it's the wrong approach and anyway i recently 
tried out this approach being direct and what i  

858
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,520
found is people have so much more respect for me 
because i don't come across as some politician  

859
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,560
trying to sell them something and i found it's 
worked so much better because people recognize  

860
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,880
that we're not calling them hypocrites because 
we don't like them we're doing it because we  

861
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,240
don't like animal abuse and we're against the 
torture of animals that's a big point unless  

862
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:25,680
you have an ego issue this shouldn't be seen 
as malicious by the person you're speaking to  

863
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,120
unless you have an ego issue and you just want 
to be right all the time and you're trying to own  

864
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,880
people and that's the only reason why you're doing 
activism then people may respond negatively to you  

865
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,560
but what they pick up on is that your heart is in 
the right place when you say this stuff you're not  

866
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,840
saying this stuff for any other reason you 
only know this to be true if you apply it  

867
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,640
no matter what i say no matter what hudson just 
said you need to apply this put aside everything  

868
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,920
you've learned about outreach about everything 
you've learned about animal rights activism and  

869
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,680
just apply this not just today but for the 
following cubes that occur after today keep  

870
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:08,640
doing this and see what results you have because 
again this is the reason why you went vegan  

871
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:13,040
because you don't want to be a hypocrite you don't 
want to be an animal abuser and someone called you  

872
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:19,600
out on your hypocrisy if it wasn't someone else 
it was yourself that made this distinction oh

873
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:30,320
i know it's crazy but apparently i need to 
make this distinction for people when i say  

874
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:38,720
holding non-vegans accountable i don't mean 
forcing people to go vegan you can't hold  

875
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:44,160
people accountable in the true sense of the word 
because people have to hold themselves accountable  

876
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:52,000
in the end it has to be a choice that comes from 
them when i say holding people accountable it's  

877
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:59,600
to the greatest extent that we can 
possibly do so through verbal interaction  

878
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,520
okay i didn't think i needed to clarify that but 
i've been getting comments and dms from people  

879
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,200
saying you can't force anyone to be vegan 
this holding non-vegans accountable approach  

880
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,040
is off base because people can 
only hold themselves accountable  

881
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:21,840
well this approach puts people in the best 
position to hold themselves accountable  

882
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:30,720
and that's the truth does this make sense to 
everybody so thanks for the uh comments about  

883
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:36,160
the audio there i'm doing my best here with the 
technical end of things but let's just go back  

884
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,560
doing this and see what results you have because 
again this is the reason why you went vegan  

885
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,800
because you don't want to be a hypocrite you don't 
want to be an animal abuser and someone called  

886
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:54,080
you out on your hypocrisy if it wasn't someone 
else it was yourself that made this distinction

887
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,880
does this make sense to 
everybody are you feeling this

888
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:06,240
all right now i'm going to take questions your 
hand went up lightning fast i got to respect that  

889
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:13,120
quickly what's your opinion on joaquin 
phoenix's oscar speech on the long reaching  

890
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,840
effectiveness of that i loved it but it's 
i wouldn't have said exactly what he said  

891
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:22,880
but i love the fact that he used his platform 
to talk about what happens in the dairy industry  

892
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,240
i didn't like how he conflated it with love and 
compassion so much because i don't think you need  

893
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,520
to love animals to not stab them to death you 
don't need to love black people to know that  

894
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,960
they deserve their rights you don't need to love 
any being to know that they deserve their rights  

895
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,840
it's not the perfect message but i still think 
it was great that he did that i also want to  

896
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:50,640
point out that joaquin phoenix said that meat and 
dairy is the third leading cause of environmental  

897
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:55,600
destruction or climate crisis but didn't we 
hear in conspiracy that it was the leading cause  

898
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,440
so why the [ __ ] are we even doing this why are 
we even promoting environmentalism and trying to  

899
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:07,600
use environmental facts when it keeps changing 
on us when it comes to these things studies can  

900
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:15,840
come back to us that may prove us wrong on the 
environment tip in fact i've seen it proven that  

901
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,520
you can be environmentally way more 
better off as a non-vegan than a vegan  

902
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:28,720
in many circumstances if you live in a rural area 
you're a minimalist and you fish from your kayak  

903
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,400
you're way more environmentally friendly than 
a person who lives in new york procreates  

904
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:43,120
eats processed foods so environmentally this is 
not a surefire argument this really isn't and i  

905
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,160
just want to say from the health point of view can 
also be justified you can eat a piece of cheese or  

906
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:54,400
you can eat a salmon once a week and justify that 
from a health perspective because you just bounce  

907
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,520
back very easily from a health point of view you 
can feel better pretty quickly so there's no point  

908
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:07,360
of even arguing the health and the environment for 
those reasons next question even if that were true  

909
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,000
reply like because i found that to be quite 
good and when you say even if that were true  

910
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,040
how do you justify this do you ever use that at 
all i do i've been using that recently people  

911
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:24,400
say i think there's bigger issues in the world 
right human issues are more important well even  

912
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,400
if there are bigger issues in the world which 
we actually know that this is the biggest issue  

913
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,720
with the health and environment the only reason 
why we're talking about it is because animal  

914
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:40,640
rights is such an issue that it's impacted our 
environment it's become that big of an issue that  

915
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:48,640
it impacts our environment and it impacts human 
health to the extent that it does but we can give  

916
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,440
them that still and say even if there are bigger 
issues what justifies you doing this to them

917
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:02,560
any other questions yes i've found on the internet 
so you put something up about veganism a lot of  

918
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,800
people just put like you know means to take the 
piss out of the veganism people sort of just go  

919
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,520
straight to that and they won't listen to 
you after that like so they take the piss  

920
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,160
out of what you're trying to do and then you just 
can't get through to them at all because they're  

921
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:21,760
so fixated on taking the piss out of us how 
would you get through take the piss out of them

922
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,240
roast them in return they're the ones that 
are supposed to be roasted yeah but if they're  

923
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:34,000
just trolling they're not reachable but my simple 
response would be to roast them back but sometimes  

924
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,880
it's just like people are more drawn to a picture 
or something because the bulk amount of people  

925
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,400
can just you know gang up on you like that and 
it makes you feel like you know you should just  

926
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,440
stop talking like it's sort of hard it feels 
like you're trapped in that position where  

927
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:55,600
you know like there's no actual response that's 
worth and then it just makes you think oh you know  

928
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,400
what i'm doing am i actually doing the right thing 
is it worth me spending my time doing this you're  

929
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,960
definitely doing the right thing when you speak 
up for the animals it's always a good idea it's  

930
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,080
always worth doing i think your question is is 
it effective to be doing that is that what you're  

931
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,200
asking yeah so i don't know like with regards to 
the comments that coming in on your facebook or  

932
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,520
instagram i don't know if those individuals are 
going to go vegan but it may be more about who's  

933
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,880
reading it you know what i'm saying the imprint 
that you leave on those individuals it's important  

934
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:30,560
that you only focus on what you're saying and how 
you advocate for the animals so that if anybody  

935
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,680
ever does stumble across the comment thread that 
they read the right thing they hear what they're  

936
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:40,400
supposed to hear from you know what i'm trying to 
get at yeah yeah and that's the best you can do  

937
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,800
whether you should be doing this with those 
individuals i don't know because you'd have  

938
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,240
to give me more specific examples about what 
they're saying and how they're saying it  

939
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,080
but if they're dropping memes about 
eating meat and how tasty bacon is  

940
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,160
i've actually found that roasting 
those people can be pretty effective  

941
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,560
don't waste too much energy on it you may want 
to block them after a certain point once you've  

942
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,760
made your point for people to read so you may 
want to manage it that way on social media  

943
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:13,840
but as long as you say the correct thing you're 
in the right space yes um paul um i just wrote  

944
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,520
down this thing that i was going to say when you 
were talking about the blood on your hand on their  

945
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,840
hands so i found it actually harder to speak to 
people that i know personally that love animals  

946
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,160
um also they love animals they actually i've 
lost four people that i've known for a long  

947
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:33,600
time because they they seem to think that my 
message is hateful so people who have tried  

948
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:39,120
to break down the barriers um around animals 
in agriculture they reject any notion of even

949
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,800
so when my compassion for the animals involved 
into more what you would call aggression and  

950
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:55,040
like passionate speaking and ask why they can 
ignore those animals quite um and can be hateful  

951
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,000
how do we get people to abandon a lifetime 
of adoption and views around farm animals  

952
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,800
particularly as people seem to not acknowledge 
their sentience or even have any regard for  

953
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,520
them as if they're not relevant other 
than as a commodity so i've found that  

954
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,800
by trying to get people to engage their 
compassion or even their sense of justice around

955
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:26,720
animals yeah and you're the only one who's 
making them visible or attempting to at  

956
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:35,840
this point yes like they know that that you know 
advertising exists but they actually don't connect

957
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:45,440
they have to disconnect in order to sleep at night 
and what you represent is a mirror you're a mirror  

958
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,720
and when they call you hateful you are actually 
hateful but not to them you're hateful to their  

959
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:55,360
actions they're the abuse that's occurring to the 
animals so don't again don't let people shame you  

960
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:01,360
out of these things yes you are hateful own it 
you are hateful you do hate what they're doing  

961
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:05,280
to animals that's why you're speaking up and 
that's why you're passionate you're not just  

962
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,520
passionate this is an art we're talking about 
you're not just passionate about this this is  

963
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:15,840
an injustice and you are angry you hate the fact 
that your friends people you love are so willing  

964
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:21,600
to make excuses for something 
so unbelievably unjustifiable  

965
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:29,200
right that's what you hate the fact that they're 
yeah but like even the people that you outreach to  

966
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,800
like actually trying to make them feel something 
though because it could be on their radar

967
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,760
what from what you've told me i actually think 
that they do have it on their radar because  

968
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,840
that's why they're trying to disconnect and call 
you hateful things when they say things that are  

969
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,880
inaccurate and irrational it's a sign that they 
do have guilt and guilt is a sign of them caring  

970
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,440
about the subject it's just so far buried down 
there because that's where it needs to be for  

971
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:04,400
them to sleep at do you understand these people 
do care about this issue you're just living proof  

972
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:11,280
of it being made into action and having your your 
actions aligned with your morals and you represent  

973
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,360
something to them that makes them feel 
inadequate and they should [ __ ] feel that way

974
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,000
you do hate what they're doing 
to the animals let them know that  

975
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:24,720
that you don't respect what they're doing to 
the animals and there's no way that they can  

976
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,600
justify it keep asking them how do you justify 
this even if you think that a cow doesn't feel  

977
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,560
the same way as a dog or the same way more 
importantly don't use a dog as an example use them  

978
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,280
how would you feel if you're in a cow's position 
what crime has a cow committed other than being  

979
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:45,520
born non-human there's no way they can justify so 
asking these basic questions usually will lead you  

980
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:55,040
to having them face the facts and a vegan well 
they may temporarily but if that's the reason i  

981
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,760
don't talk to you anymore for someone who is a 
concerned citizen speaking up against injustice  

982
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,720
then they're not really your friend are they 
friends don't abandon friends over something so  

983
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:12,880
obviously righteous like that even if they're 
the perpetrator again they can't justify it  

984
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,080
a real friend would be like you know what i 
respect the fact that you called me out and  

985
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:23,680
there's nothing i can say like i am hypocrite 
and i am an animal abuser or even if they don't  

986
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,040
admit to that they would at least keep you in 
their lives if they respected the fact that  

987
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,800
you're speaking up against this and then it's 
up to you how long you keep them in your lives

988
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,840
does that help yeah thanks a lot cool

989
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:59,600
stop share so there it is that was the holding 
non-vegans accountable 2.0 from perth australia  

990
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,320
that was the second stop on the australian leg  

991
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,040
of the world tour that we 
embarked on in february which got

992
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,000
put to an end due to the coronavirus  

993
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,840
so i will take questions and i will also 
start using this presentation with the  

994
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,720
slides to break down this whole thing once over 
just to reiterate all the points that were made

995
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,560
it is good to feel bad about 
something that is bad simple  

996
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:42,720
i love simplicity and effectiveness 
the simpler the better

997
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,920
in terms of effectiveness it has 
to have that effectiveness there  

998
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,840
but the simplicity i just love that so much okay

999
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,640
so i'm gonna get these slides downloaded  

1000
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,920
but if you guys have any questions 
lace me up in the comments

1001
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,560
okay where is this

1002
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:15,680
here we are

1003
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:23,360
all right so i'm going to go 
over everything once more just  

1004
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,480
to reiterate all these points and make 
sure you guys fully understand them  

1005
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:33,680
there was a complaint about my speaking voice 
how is the audio coming through let me know

1006
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,840
oh

1007
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,280
nope this isn't it

1008
01:45:52,320 --> 01:46:11,840
this is it um

1009
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,720
um okay so question by carlo hi paul 
once you understand that the person  

1010
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,840
you are talking to is not going to be interested 
in the topic and continues justifying animal abuse  

1011
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:32,800
what do you say to them before going away all 
these examples you saw and everything that we  

1012
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,520
said in the approach applies to these 
individuals the only difference is that  

1013
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:45,520
at some i'm assuming that these people 
probably at a cube of truth probably  

1014
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,840
won't even stop but if they do stop and 
you're talking to them at some point  

1015
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:57,680
it could be really powerful for you to just end 
the discussion with that that uh statement that  

1016
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:05,440
was made at the end of the interaction you saw 
examples from hudson and jacob um just know that  

1017
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:12,240
for as long as you remain non-vegan these animals 
will be tortured and abused because of you and  

1018
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:20,000
just decide what side of history so i'll 
i'll leave this with you to think about but  

1019
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:26,320
you ultimately will need to decide which side of 
history you want to stand on something powerful  

1020
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:32,000
like that a statement like that is all you can 
really do with those individuals and i i just want  

1021
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,840
to say that it's important that you respect your 
time as an activist and that you're not wasting  

1022
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:45,120
your breath on people so it's very powerful to 
say to the individual that you would like to  

1023
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,160
carry on your work with those who are like you'd 
like to move on you know so ending the discussion  

1024
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:54,000
and moving on after you make that statement is 
super powerful and that's what you should do

1025
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:07,200
audio is fine good thank you guys 
i've got the slide ready i'm just  

1026
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:17,840
going to read through your comments 
and see if there's any questions

1027
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:27,120
david's saying i would only say i 
wouldn't mind if an animal killed me  

1028
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:32,400
but i would say i would eat you would say 
that you would eat a human okay david you uh  

1029
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,000
you sound a bit confused buddy i don't 
think you would be okay with an animal  

1030
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,320
eating you if you had a choice and 
you have a choice not to eat animals  

1031
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:51,680
so you're the oppressor and the power is in your 
hands to end the suffering and abuse and torture  

1032
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:59,200
that you would inflict on these animals otherwise 
if you choose to continue to be a non-vegan human  

1033
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:05,760
supremacist because that's what non-vegans are 
human supremacists and you are subscribing to this  

1034
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:10,800
death cult you're subscribing to this 
idea that animals should be reduced  

1035
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:17,680
to a sandwich through violent 
beheadings and enslavement and torture

1036
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:27,840
david says it's an excuse but i'm 
addicted addiction isn't a justification  

1037
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,880
so let's hope that david gets the message 
here and does actually connect his actions  

1038
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,560
to his words and ends his hypocrisy for real but 
let's move on to your other questions here guys  

1039
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:47,440
can you say something about infighting between 
vegans and outreach organizations i hate it and  

1040
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,360
how to stop this welcome to the animal rights 
movement if you know how i can stop this i'd  

1041
01:49:53,360 --> 01:50:00,880
like to know um vegans are the biggest threat 
to the animal rights movement i've been saying  

1042
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:08,160
this for a while i learned this the hard way gary 
told me told everyone and i didn't think it was  

1043
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:15,760
necessarily true either at first but i've come 
to learn this very much so humans what can i say  

1044
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:24,320
it's terrible but one thing that gives me optimism 
and hope is that there are plenty of us out there  

1045
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,280
who vibrate on this frequency and that's all 
we need to do to continue moving forward is  

1046
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:36,240
us supporting us so when i read your comments 
supporting av supporting me and asal and the  

1047
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:40,960
whole av team we appreciate it so much 
because it means that we are working  

1048
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,680
together we do have unity between those who 
vibrate on this frequency and that's important  

1049
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,360
where can you get the new outreach cards from 
your organizer if there's no organizer in  

1050
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:59,600
your city go over to our website and go to the 
join section and apply to become an organizer  

1051
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:05,840
so that you can launch a cube of truth a chapter 
in your city where cuba truth events operate

1052
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,000
lots of questions coming through

1053
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,960
how do i respond to people that 
say they can't go vegan because of  

1054
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,200
medical advice point them to 
all of the medical advice that  

1055
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,240
that says otherwise we have empirical data 
that shows that it's perfectly adequate for  

1056
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:39,200
all human beings to be on a plant-based diet 
point them to the evidence there's only one  

1057
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:48,400
source of scientific data there's only 
one database okay so michael greger is  

1058
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:54,400
a great person to look into because he breaks down 
the data so nutritionfacts.com but the thing i  

1059
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,200
just want nutritionfacts.org is the website there 
but i just want to say that this person saying  

1060
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:10,000
this most likely woody is using this as an excuse 
to not go vegan if they're truly wanting to end  

1061
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,160
the abuse that they cause to animals the needless 
suffering or in their case they think it's  

1062
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:19,280
required but if they really want to end it then 
they'll look into it and they'll do their very  

1063
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:25,280
damnedest to make it happen to to end it 
and so if you are talking to someone who's  

1064
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:30,320
truly trying to end it then just give them that 
information that should be enough but usually  

1065
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:43,840
it comes back to accountability in those cases 
usually people are just using that as an excuse

1066
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,280
is it cruel to raise kids 
non-vegan it's cruel to the animals  

1067
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,400
yeah and it is cruel to humans on some 
level but it's not even comparable to  

1068
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:01,040
what we do to the animals so i'm not even 
going to say it's cruel to the humans um so

1069
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:09,120
what was the other part of that 
question um saying this as a mother  

1070
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,440
it's cruel to the animals and you're robbing 
children and you're robbing children over there  

1071
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,880
you're making them confused and you're robbing 
them off i mean every vegan will say they wish  

1072
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,800
they were vegan since birth so you're robbing 
them of that opportunity to do the right thing  

1073
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:30,720
when kids are just doing what their parents 
tell them to do so when non-vegans say don't  

1074
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:36,080
force this on your children they're forcing 
non-veganism on their children parenting is  

1075
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:43,040
forcing that's what parenting is they do what 
their parents tell them to do up until they're 18.  

1076
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:50,320
so it's if you're gonna have to choose a diet for 
them why wouldn't you choose the one that doesn't  

1077
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:56,960
involve bloodshed abuse torture suffering when 
it's needless that's my answer to that question

1078
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:07,840
much love jeanette appreciate your comment

1079
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:10,640
um

1080
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,640
how do you convince religious people or anyone 
who is used to seeing animal abuse since young  

1081
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:23,920
to feel something for the animals that's two 
different questions there religious people

1082
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,240
it's no different this whole approach is no  

1083
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,200
different if people say i 
believe god said it's okay

1084
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:39,280
classic gary quote if god says this 
is okay then what does the devil do

1085
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,160
just you're not going to get through 
to most religious people you just  

1086
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,080
need to ask them these really tough questions  

1087
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,720
and treat them no different to anyone else 
with the approach that we're giving you

1088
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,320
okay um and that second question 
i think i've already answered

1089
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:08,640
generally all right guys um there are other 
questions here and if you're not going to stay  

1090
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:12,960
on this stream you can watch this back when this 
video goes up and i will respond to your question  

1091
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:18,480
at some point but i'm now going to get into 
the slides in the interest of time management

1092
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,960
right i'm gonna share this 
and i'm just gonna go through  

1093
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:37,440
each of the points that were raised 
in that workshop for you guys

1094
01:55:43,440 --> 01:56:01,040
all right sharing my screen once again whoops

1095
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,720
all right can you guys see that okay

1096
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,360
i'm confident that you can but just to make sure  

1097
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:28,240
let me know in the comments if you can 
see that slide i'm about to go through

1098
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:42,080
i just need one of you guys to 
confirm and then i'll continue  

1099
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,160
can you see the outreach workshop slides

1100
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:55,840
okay

1101
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:07,760
all good cool thanks guys all right so let's get 
into it so this is our outreach workshop in slides  

1102
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:13,920
you might see organizers in your city or town and 
if you are an organizer or you become an organizer  

1103
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,960
your organizer may run through a workshop with 
you in your city and they'll use these slides  

1104
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,840
and these slides may be updated from time to 
time but right now this is our most updated  

1105
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:33,280
outreach workshop in slide format so let's let's 
go so we start with this important question  

1106
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,760
what even is veganism if you ask a 
group of people what it means to be  

1107
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:41,520
vegan you most likely will get multiple 
versions of what they believe it to be  

1108
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,800
veganism has nothing to do with our health the 
environment human rights or affection towards  

1109
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:53,520
animals it is not about justice for non-human 
animal rights vegan equals anti-animal abuse  

1110
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:58,320
now i'm not going to make any extra points 
here unless they naturally come to me  

1111
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:05,280
but if you guys in the comments want to make any 
points or any questions about this slide be as  

1112
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:12,240
quick as you can while this slides up i'm gonna 
wait two minutes between each slide so that if  

1113
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:17,680
there's anything specifically that you would like 
me to address regarding the points on each slide  

1114
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:23,200
i'll address them as we go so two minutes starting 
now i'm going to start my stopwatch on my phone

1115
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,720
you know we have to start with the definition 
of veganism before we even talk about activism  

1116
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:36,720
so two minutes if anyone wants to 
discuss anything here let me know

1117
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:47,840
it's two minutes too long maybe 
i should just do one minute

1118
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,600
yeah common sense and self-explanatory 
this slide all right well i'm i'm gonna  

1119
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:09,200
reduce that to one minute so we've got 30 
seconds to go i think one minute is plenty  

1120
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:15,840
i don't have anything i'd like to add to 
this it's very straightforward like you said

1121
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,400
so 10 seconds i'm assuming 
there's no questions here  

1122
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:30,960
i'm an admin of the malaysian vegan facebook 
group one question we ask people who request  

1123
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:36,000
to join is what veganism means to them most 
of them say it's kindness and great health

1124
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:43,840
wow yeah that's just typical isn't it it's a 
very common thing in the animal rights movement  

1125
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:48,240
and the other thing i want to point out is 
you know when you ask what the benefit is  

1126
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:55,040
most people say health or the environment which 
just goes to prove we don't need to talk about  

1127
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:59,440
health and the environment with people and talk 
about them as benefits and act like that's what  

1128
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:04,400
animal rights is all about people already know 
about those things what they really need to hear  

1129
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:11,840
is accountability for what they're 
doing to the animals that's it moving on

1130
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:23,760
all right so what is animal rights activism 
activism is speaking up for the victims  

1131
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,360
in the same way that you would want to be 
spoken up for if you were in their position  

1132
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:35,200
it is being a medium of truth and enacting change 
by prioritizing the victims and not the oppressors  

1133
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,880
one minute starting now i don't 
have anything to add to this either

1134
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,280
this might even change to 30 seconds because i 
don't want to drag this out for people watching  

1135
02:00:55,280 --> 02:01:01,680
this back i want this to be as succinct as 
possible but i just want to make sure i cover any  

1136
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:06,720
questions or points that might come up i just want 
to be as thorough as possible in addressing this i  

1137
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:21,840
think i might reduce the time that i put aside for 
you guys to 30 seconds in fact instead of a minute

1138
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:37,600
all right let's move on yeah i'm going to 
reduce this down to 30 seconds between slides  

1139
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:42,560
to allow you guys to jump in if you want 
me to discuss anything more specifically

1140
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,840
crystal clear says carlo great

1141
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:56,880
don't try to be a communications guru 
this goes back to the sales thing almost  

1142
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:04,240
um always remember that you will never have 
100 success rate within animal rights outreach  

1143
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:08,880
there is no magic set of words to use during 
outreach that will make someone go vegan  

1144
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:15,120
if they're ready they'll listen if they're not 
ready they won't with the context provided your  

1145
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:19,920
function as an activist is to hold the individual 
you're speaking with accountable for the animal  

1146
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:31,840
abuse they support and to make them aware of 
the consequences of their choices 30 seconds

1147
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,240
is too quick 30 seconds

1148
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:50,640
if it's too quick uh how about we just 
do a compromise make it 45 seconds

1149
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:59,840
i just don't want it to get too 
slow for those watching this back

1150
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,840
you know

1151
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:17,360
okay

1152
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:27,840
cool all right so let's move 
on we've done 45 seconds there

1153
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:36,000
30 david's voting 30. all right let's 
move on so your goal should not be to  

1154
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,400
plant seeds animal rights outreach is not 
verbal leafleting i'm going to repeat that  

1155
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:47,040
standing in front of a non-vegan and spitting 
all these little factoids out at them  

1156
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:53,440
is not activism and i heard someone say planting 
seeds in the comments i mean i know planting seeds  

1157
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:59,280
is like a common term used in the animal rights 
movement specifically but i guess we're doing that  

1158
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:04,800
but it's not in the same way that people think of 
planting seeds that's not what we're doing here  

1159
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:13,360
animal rights outreach is not verbal leafleting 
if the goal were to provide information we would  

1160
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:19,040
hand out leaflets and magazines and if that was 
all that people needed to go out to go vegan then

1161
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,960
the information is already out there so 
it's not necessarily about the information  

1162
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,440
the function of outreach is to make 
people understand the consequences of  

1163
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:35,200
their choices by holding them accountable 
and centering the interaction on what they  

1164
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:39,600
can personally do about the animal 
of the use on an individual level

1165
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,440
45 seconds

1166
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:56,640
is there anything here that you guys have any 
questions about i don't apologize um you know  

1167
02:04:56,640 --> 02:05:01,280
don't apologize this is a learning process i'm 
taking you guys on i've learned this stuff and  

1168
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:06,560
i'm just teaching you guys what i've learned 
and what we've learned together actually so

1169
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:17,360
not verbal leafleting is the biggest 
part of this slide no verbal leafleting  

1170
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:23,920
that's just cancer in the animal rights movement 
i've seen it so many times i've done it myself  

1171
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:29,680
it gets you nowhere and it makes this message 
seem even more of a like a mockery to people  

1172
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:36,320
like it's it takes it takes it down a notch to 
then being taken less seriously so all right  

1173
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:52,640
that's 45 seconds moving on veganism is not 
love or compassion veganism is about justice  

1174
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:59,440
your likability does not determine your rights so 
out i'm going to repeat that just because someone  

1175
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:02,960
doesn't like you it doesn't mean they have 
the right to take your rights away from you  

1176
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:09,040
so that's why we don't need to lean into how much 
people like animals that's just the wrong way to  

1177
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:15,440
communicate this message outreach is not about 
how you or anyone else feels about animals if  

1178
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:20,800
you don't go around beating children you aren't 
instantly a compassionate individual refraining  

1179
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:26,560
from injustice does not make you compassionate by 
default and we can see that because in the animal  

1180
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:32,080
rights movement vegans are some of the least 
compassionate people that i have to deal with  

1181
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:39,520
veganism is a non-action it's not loving 
it's merely the right thing to do 45

1182
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:43,840
seconds

1183
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,840
all right i'm reading your comments guys if  

1184
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:57,840
there's anything you want me 
to expand on now's your time

1185
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:26,240
you know what i'm going to reduce this back down 
to 30 seconds uh and if you guys like need more  

1186
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:33,200
time to write your comment just start off with 
a comment that you can just send out real quick  

1187
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:38,560
that says i have a comment or i have something 
i want to add and then i will wait for you to  

1188
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:43,120
write your longer question if this is too quick 
so i'm going to reduce this back to 30 seconds  

1189
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,440
and that's what you can do if you have any 
questions but there are questions coming in now  

1190
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:53,760
so i will answer them what does leaf litting mean 
leafleting means handing out pieces of information  

1191
02:07:53,760 --> 02:08:00,720
to people and then it's just like all these little 
factoids about like how old chickens are when  

1192
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:08,080
they're murdered and all these things and you know 
the the irony of how counterproductive this is is  

1193
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:15,840
obvious to me because so many non-vegans already 
know about how much of a shocker the meat dairy  

1194
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:21,120
and egg industries are they already know that they 
treat animals horribly they already know about how  

1195
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:26,240
young the animals are when they're murdered and 
all these crazy statistics and it's very easy  

1196
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:32,640
to find out but it doesn't make people go vegan 
because knowing all these factoids is one thing  

1197
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,840
and yes that might cause some people to go 
vegan i take that back i know some of you  

1198
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,600
thinking well i went vegan when i looked 
into the dairy industry but at some point  

1199
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:46,720
there was accountability for your actions and 
wanting to be accountable for yourself for what  

1200
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:53,120
you're doing to them and yeah that's what it 
comes down to these factoids don't really push  

1201
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,200
people towards it it just puts them in a position 
where they just feel like they need to continue  

1202
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:03,840
arguing the points and all this stuff and it's 
just it's not it's not very effective at all so

1203
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,680
let's see if there's any other comments here

1204
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:18,400
ariane huge comment very well said people 
will forget about the facts anyways  

1205
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:22,320
what they will remember is the 
guilty feeling when they hear  

1206
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:28,480
that they are animal abusers so just to expand 
on ariane's point here and point out how  

1207
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:35,440
how true that is there's a really great quote that 
everyone knows and it's just so true people don't  

1208
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:45,840
remember what you said they remember how they felt 
when you said it and that's what this is all about

1209
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:57,600
yeah veganism is about justice we 
can't point that out enough seemingly  

1210
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:05,040
so we cannot point it out enough all right moving 
on guys thanks for your comments i appreciate it  

1211
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,600
i just want to make sure that i 
cover everything for you guys and  

1212
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,840
i appreciate you guys being a part of 
this live stream all right moving on

1213
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,680
this approach is pure honesty telling someone the 
truth is the most respectful thing you can do for  

1214
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:29,040
them when you agree with every statement said by 
the bystander they will often lose respect for you  

1215
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:35,600
and you will lose respect so you will lose control 
of the conversation they see that your desire to  

1216
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:41,760
be validated by them is stronger than your desire 
to end animal cruelty thereby making a mockery of  

1217
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:47,440
animal rights this one needs to be repeated 
they see that your desire to be validated by  

1218
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:56,000
them is stronger than your desire to end animal 
cruelty thereby making a mockery of animal rights  

1219
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,400
you imagine if the primary goal of human rights 
activists was to be liked by the oppressors

1220
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:09,840
30 seconds

1221
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,080
all right that's 30 seconds i'm liking 
the 30 seconds it feels like the right  

1222
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:41,280
amount of time here moving on

1223
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:49,360
whenever you are afraid to speak up for animals 
directly or if bystanders call you too extreme  

1224
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:56,160
place yourself in the victim's position and 
analyze your approach from their perspective would  

1225
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:02,320
you consider a respectful yet direct conversation 
too extreme if you were locked in a slaughterhouse  

1226
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:08,800
and that's the thing you know we are being 
respectful here it's the most respect you'll  

1227
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,800
ever show someone because you're telling 
the truth and giving them a true opportunity  

1228
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:21,360
to end their hypocrisy and to stop 
abusing innocent beings like a psychopath

1229
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,760
like a cold-blooded monster 
that's what these people  

1230
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:33,840
are especially once they know about what is 
going on and they continue to do it right  

1231
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:41,760
um i forgot to press start on the 30 seconds 
so let's just say we're up to 15 seconds now

1232
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:55,120
yes honesty is the highest form of intimacy this 
might be irritating to some but it may not stop us  

1233
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,480
from telling the truth that's beautiful 
yeah that's so true honesty is the  

1234
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:18,400
highest form of intimacy word all right 
moving on guys all right so next slide  

1235
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:25,360
don't talk about health and environment 
why do we think people care about either  

1236
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,360
most people in the streets do not care 
about their health nor the environment  

1237
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:37,360
so rooting your outreach in these topics will 
marginalize the animals even further health and  

1238
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:44,480
environment may become have become exacerbated 
because people do not take animal abuse seriously

1239
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:50,320
um again i need to repeat this 
point because this is really  

1240
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:56,720
powerful to know and understand that these 
crisis that we're facing that we're facing  

1241
02:13:56,720 --> 02:14:00,080
that we're facing with our 
environment and our health  

1242
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:11,840
is just an indication merely a a sign that's all 
it is of how bad animal abuse is on this planet

1243
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:21,280
again i was supposed to press start there 
um oh no i haven't finished this all right  

1244
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,840
um the last point trying to hook people with 
an approach that revolves around what benefits  

1245
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:34,240
them does not let me start again trying to hook 
people with an approach that revolves around what  

1246
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,400
that revolves around what benefits 
them does a disservice to the animals  

1247
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,160
focus on the root cause of 
the issue the animal abuse

1248
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:50,160
i kind of stumbled through that one but you 
get the point you can see it i'm going to  

1249
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:54,960
start this 30 seconds if you guys have anything 
you'd like me to expand on here let me know

1250
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:02,240
people say this is fake that it's not 
true what to say just point at the screens  

1251
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:07,840
what part of this is fake challenge them to go 
into a farm for themselves and see what happens  

1252
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:13,920
in a slaughterhouse specifically say because 
that's where all the animals end up right

1253
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:18,160
uh i

1254
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:26,400
i feel that i don't want to be friends with 
people after giving information anymore  

1255
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:30,000
who won't go vegan well that's 
the right position i think  

1256
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,920
you wouldn't again when you compare this 
to any other injustice you wouldn't stick  

1257
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,200
around and be friends with people who continue to 
enslave torture and murder once they know better

1258
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:48,800
if we were the victims we would not want our 
advocates to prioritize the environment or our  

1259
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:54,720
oppressor's health no and it would it would be a 
huge spit in your face to do that that's the whole  

1260
02:15:54,720 --> 02:16:01,520
point of clarifying this for you guys because 
the victims deserve so much better from us to  

1261
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,400
be advocating directly for them and they they do 
deserve a direct message that's dedicated to them

1262
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:23,040
yes yes okay um what are some variable ways 
to start the conversation other than have  

1263
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,480
you seen this type of footage before we don't 
actually ask that anymore have you seen this  

1264
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:31,520
type of footage before we do sometimes 
but in this approach with this update  

1265
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:35,280
you don't need to ask that in fact what we do 
is we say would you like to know why we're here  

1266
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:40,240
um so vegan mark i'm not sure if you're just 
joining the stream but we did cover this you  

1267
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:44,240
might want to watch this video back and it will 
be available for everyone to watch back once i'm  

1268
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:51,200
done and we did cover that raping is bad for 
your health yeah that's what it sounds like

1269
02:16:55,439 --> 02:17:00,879
never met a 100 zero waste and whole food 
vegan so why expect non-vegans to care  

1270
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:08,240
exactly summer it's so obvious isn't it i always 
say health and environment are just consequences  

1271
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:14,719
of animal abuse and our mentality towards animals 
and if we want to solve a problem we have to pull  

1272
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:20,560
the root of evil out very well said david if 
you said that to me when i wasn't vegan that  

1273
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:27,121
would punch me in the stomach in the best way you 
can see you can say would you like to know why  

1274
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,080
we're here today yes thank you jaz you've been 
paying attention all right cool let's move on

1275
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:43,040
why don't people care about ethics let's explore 
that because vegans don't advocate for animals  

1276
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:50,960
correctly they focus on things like plant-based 
recipes restaurants weight loss or deforestation  

1277
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,240
another reason is they lead with 
phrases like friends not food  

1278
02:17:56,240 --> 02:18:02,080
or animal lovers don't eat animals this 
is not a conversation about sympathy  

1279
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:09,120
this is a conversation about accountability 
don't plead with bystanders make them understand  

1280
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,040
the consequences of their choices by 
placing them in the victim's position  

1281
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:23,840
30 seconds i don't have anything else to add 
to this unless you guys want me to expand on it

1282
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:42,559
um check out the majority of vegans online 
rather not just on instagram vegan king  

1283
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,280
they don't even talk about animals yeah 
it seems like in this movement that the  

1284
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:54,240
animals barely get a mention they barely get a 
shout out and we quickly move on to humans and  

1285
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:58,080
humans humans humans how does this 
affect humans let's talk about that

1286
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,240
when humans are the oppressors it's just

1287
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:05,840
backwards

1288
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,760
all right cool you guys don't have anything uh you 
want me to expand on here so i'm going to move on  

1289
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:22,160
all right next slide morality is black and white 
when it comes to this issue specifically i'm  

1290
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,760
talking about guys okay i'm not talking about 
these fringe gray area examples that could be  

1291
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:34,320
brought up with very insignificant choices 
you could say this is very significant and  

1292
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:40,240
it's involving in it's involving oppression so 
when you're talking about an issue of oppression  

1293
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:48,559
where there are victims involved morality is black 
and white when it comes to that if bystanders tell  

1294
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:54,560
you that you aren't considering the other side 
to this or you aren't open-minded enough that is  

1295
02:19:54,560 --> 02:20:02,081
a distraction there is no other side to needless 
animal abuse you either support it or you don't  

1296
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:07,680
don't get lost in these distractions compare 
animal abuse to a comparable injustice to get  

1297
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:13,040
you back on track and like i was saying earlier 
on in this video the best injustice to compare to  

1298
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:19,600
is the one that involves the individual you're 
speaking to as the victim so if they imagine  

1299
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:25,121
themselves as the victim of the injustice that 
you're speaking about when you compare it that's  

1300
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:43,840
going to be the best way for them to feel what 
it is they need to feel in that moment 30 seconds

1301
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,399
good night daniel thank you 
for being a part of this man

1302
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,880
uh i don't know who epa is david

1303
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,200
all right we've done 30 seconds i 
don't see anything you guys want me to  

1304
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,840
expand on here so we're going to move on

1305
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:19,680
all right moving on so the next 
slide where we got to the 12th slide  

1306
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:28,400
okay which injustices to compare to so i 
actually break this last point i just made  

1307
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:33,040
even further down in this slide it is most 
effective to compare to injustices such as  

1308
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:38,960
child abuse or human trafficking child abuse and 
human trafficking are the most comparable human  

1309
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:46,319
injustices that we've found to compare to the 
most effective comparison to make is to place  

1310
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:52,799
the bystander in the victim's position i just 
explained that but that's there for you again to  

1311
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:58,639
absorb i really want you to take that 
into consideration and really absorb that  

1312
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:02,241
avoid dog comparisons this goes 
back to not leading with compassion  

1313
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:09,121
it's not about the love people feel towards 
animals it's about the hate they feel towards  

1314
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:17,120
injustice and i would say injustice in their name 
or because of them not in their name but because  

1315
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:23,519
of their actions right in their name is kind of an 
ego thing it doesn't come down to whether you can  

1316
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:28,000
imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse it comes 
down to whether you can imagine yourself in a  

1317
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,640
slaughterhouse right i'm going to repeat that it 
doesn't come down to whether you can imagine your  

1318
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:38,320
dog in a slaughterhouse it comes down to whether 
you can imagine yourself in a slaughterhouse  

1319
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:49,840
that's the truth that's what makes 
you really wake up to this 30 seconds

1320
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:25,680
yeah so carlo about the moralities 
black and white you have to  

1321
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,840
clarify that specifically we're talking 
about injustices that involve victims  

1322
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:38,559
oppression these things are black and white 
if it's needless and this is it needs to stop  

1323
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:43,600
it's really simple you don't need to 
necessarily say morality is black and white

1324
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,480
i'm just pointing this out in this in 
this workshop for you guys that you need  

1325
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:56,160
to understand morality is black and white and the 
way that you communicate this to other people but  

1326
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:02,000
you don't necessarily need to say morality 
is black and white in those words but yeah  

1327
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,520
if people want to get into a philosophical 
discussion you know just put an end to that

1328
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:14,160
america's environmental protection agency is 
the epa which is a broken government system  

1329
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,559
uh yeah i wouldn't i don't have any interest

1330
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:33,680
um okay yeah people just say they don't mind 
eating dogs as well it happens so often yeah  

1331
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:39,360
what about dogs yeah well if i had to eat a dog 
i would it just immediately blows up in our face  

1332
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:50,399
um and i'm talking about most of the time here dog 
comparisons seemingly work niraj they seemingly  

1333
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:58,319
work because your indicator of an effective 
conversation might be someone doing this uh-huh  

1334
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:07,040
yes i agree yes uh-huh that's not necessarily 
effective it's very easy to agree with things like  

1335
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:14,080
um like if they had a dog with them and they 
obviously care about their dog like they're  

1336
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:18,319
walking with the dog and then they're showing 
you know like empathy for their dog in some way  

1337
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:23,840
and you say well what if that dog was stabbed to 
death yeah it's an easy thing to agree with yep  

1338
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:30,241
but what happens when that dog dies in the family 
how long will they take to grieve that dog's life  

1339
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:38,479
compared to a human compared to how sad 
they would feel about their own death and  

1340
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:41,439
if they were going to be 
murdered you see what i'm saying

1341
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,040
all right i'm going to move on i don't 
see any comments here wanting me to  

1342
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:53,120
expand on this particular slide i think i've 
covered as much as i can so let's move on  

1343
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:01,920
statistics keep them minimal outside of what is 
asked of you state minimal information during  

1344
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:08,240
outreach conversations we are not on the streets 
to verbally leaflet again let the footage provide  

1345
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:14,639
the context to the conversation you aren't at a 
cube of truth to be a statistician you're there  

1346
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:21,920
to have a concise conversation that holds people 
to account for their unjustified animal abuse a  

1347
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:27,120
conversation will go on for longer than necessary 
if it turns into an argument over statistic  

1348
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,520
over statistics this is another reason why you 
should bring up health and environment talking  

1349
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:40,241
points why you shouldn't pardon me this is another 
reason why you shouldn't bring up health and  

1350
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:46,319
environment talking points because that usually 
leads into a never-ending debate about nothingness  

1351
02:26:47,680 --> 02:27:01,840
seconds if you guys have any points 
you want me to expand on let me know

1352
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,399
yeah this is a good point 
here if the conversation went  

1353
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:15,920
to logic i usually believe the person won't 
go vegan try to keep it about the abuse and  

1354
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:20,160
here it says best of a logic person is to 
go plant-based veganisms from your heart  

1355
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:27,519
you do need to hit people in the chest people 
talk part of me you're talking about how  

1356
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,840
you know it's how you make people feel 
that's what people are going to remember

1357
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:34,639
moving on

1358
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:42,161
yeah it's not a debate club on the streets very 
good point street activism is not a debate club  

1359
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:50,479
moving on guys reachability and conversation 
length not everybody on the streets is worth  

1360
02:27:50,479 --> 02:27:56,240
talking to part of your role is to assess 
who is reachable and who is not many people  

1361
02:27:56,240 --> 02:28:02,080
are not reachable if they want to have a short 
conversation with you keep it short with them  

1362
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,280
don't entertain bystanders who want to engage 
in long argumentative debates we just covered  

1363
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:13,519
that do not underestimate the cunningness 
of non-vegan guilt and the ability that non  

1364
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:19,120
vegans many non-vegans will have to waste 
your vital time at work for the animals  

1365
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:22,399
that's a huge point that last one 30

1366
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:25,839
seconds

1367
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,520
yeah part of the game here 
is assessing who is reachable  

1368
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:53,840
you get better at this with practice by the way

1369
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:11,040
yeah well jezebel you're right it's also logical 
the point here is to not get lost in the logic  

1370
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,640
you have to also have what 
hits people in the chest too

1371
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:23,439
cunningness what is cunningness you 
mean the actual definition of the word

1372
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:33,760
let's look it up the actual definition of 
the word according to miriam webster is  

1373
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:40,000
skill in achieving one's ends through 
indirect subtle or underhanded means

1374
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:47,200
and here's an example it took a certain amount of 
cunningness on the photographer's part to obtain  

1375
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:55,040
such revealing portraits of his rich and famous 
subjects anyhow the way it applies here in this  

1376
02:29:55,040 --> 02:30:02,160
context is that non-vegans are very cunning in the 
way that they address these arguments with vegans  

1377
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:07,680
and the way that they try to make vegans think 
that plants have feelings for example like they  

1378
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:12,800
really get deep into it and they're like yeah 
like they feel stuff and like yeah they're like  

1379
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:23,200
they act like they really believe it but it's 
just their cunningness is a lie it's really  

1380
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:30,479
their guilt trying to double down you know so um 
are there any questions here i'm not even going  

1381
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:34,879
to do the 30 seconds thing because i've given 
you guys plenty of time while i've been talking

1382
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:46,160
yes it does stay online afterwards malia 
this will be available online once i'm done

1383
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:56,479
you can tell by their body language when they're 
not even looking at the footage because they're  

1384
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:03,600
only there to waste our time yeah if they don't 
want to be there just get them to go just go

1385
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:13,840
indirect distractions and so on yes exactly 
indirect distractions that's what it is

1386
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:27,760
all right moving on guys it doesn't seem like 
you guys want me to expand on much here so i  

1387
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:34,080
might even just keep this moving at a quicker 
pace activism is not sales sales training does  

1388
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:42,080
not equal good activism using slick talk to trick 
people into veganism doesn't work your job is to  

1389
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:49,920
hold the bystander accountable it's up to them 
which actions they take initially av made too  

1390
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:56,560
strong of a connection between sales and activism 
tools taught in sales training only go so far  

1391
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:02,880
any questions about this or anything you 
want me to expand on it 30 seconds but

1392
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,479
[ __ ] i might even reduce this 
down even further 10 seconds

1393
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:14,880
now i'll keep it at 30 seconds but uh

1394
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:26,000
let me let me know guys if you want me to break 
anything down further for you five seconds

1395
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:38,400
moving on so the next slide activism is not 
sales we're still continuing on this thing

1396
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:44,800
a successful conversation is not one 
where the bystander says i'm going vegan  

1397
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:51,440
that's not necessarily the thing that you should 
be looking for it's where you say the right things  

1398
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:57,200
most people become vegan after they hear the truth 
from us how long it takes is up to the individual

1399
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:00,160
30 seconds

1400
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:11,280
okay so uh there's a question here i'm you're 
still confused about the sales thing could you  

1401
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:19,840
give me an example or more could you be more 
specific about what you're confused about

1402
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:29,200
good question summer do you still promote feel 
felt found i never really understood what that  

1403
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:36,240
means again that was just a communication tool i 
thought it would be helpful i don't use it anymore  

1404
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:43,040
and it's not in this outreach workshop for a 
reason that you have pointed out and i appreciate  

1405
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:48,640
that we've removed it because again we make too 
strong of a connection to sales and i don't want  

1406
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:55,680
people to think that these communication tools are 
the approach like this is that's not an approach  

1407
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:02,639
that's just a tool a little tiny little tool 
that can help with your communication but feel  

1408
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:09,281
fat found no you don't really need to use 
that and we've removed it it's unnecessary

1409
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,040
what you said about giving fair warning 
before asking a question or commenting  

1410
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:26,479
is a good way to proceed awesome like 
how do we know if we've made an impact  

1411
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:32,160
on their perception apart from their 
guilt you don't uh you well you don't  

1412
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:39,359
there are certain indicators but like we say here 
most people become vegan after they hear the truth  

1413
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:47,759
from us how long it takes is up to the individual 
and that's why i say i want you to connect to this  

1414
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:54,960
approach in in i want you to connect to 
understanding that if you say the right things  

1415
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:59,359
on behalf of the victims then you have succeeded 
in your outreach because that's the best you can  

1416
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:11,839
do the next step is physically forcing people 
to become vegan which we can't do does that help

1417
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:22,799
sales is too much practical veganism 
is more from the from our internals  

1418
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:25,840
not sure what you mean there soilless magician

1419
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:32,479
is it good to start with the socratic method 
to get to know where the individual is  

1420
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:35,919
at well socratic questioning is 
something that we touch on in this  

1421
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:42,080
so jazz just stick around and i'll get into 
that further all right guys i'm gonna move on

1422
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,080
okay that does help good let's move on

1423
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,120
the socratic the very next slide there it is jazz

1424
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:03,760
maybe we sensed the line of questions that 
might come from you guys and that's why we  

1425
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:07,440
put this slide next all right so socratic 
the socratic method socratic questioning  

1426
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:13,359
is a communication tool that we use within our 
approach it is not an approach in and of itself  

1427
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:21,759
and neither is the sales thing where we ask 
questions to lead the bystander to their own  

1428
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:27,680
conclusions so yes jazz you're right and i'll 
read that again okay so credit questioning is  

1429
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:32,480
a communication tool that we use within our 
approach it is not an approach in and of itself  

1430
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:36,799
where we ask questions to lead the 
bystander to their own conclusions  

1431
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:45,839
use open-ended questions such as why are you sorry 
let me start again use open-ended questions such  

1432
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:51,840
as why are you against animal abuse instead of 
a closed statement such as animal abuse is wrong  

1433
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:56,160
open-ended questions are 
generally prefer preferred  

1434
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:03,520
i've got a problem with speaking today open-ended 
questions are generally preferred to anchor  

1435
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:17,840
and progress the conversation you should use 
closed-ended questions and statements 30 seconds  

1436
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:25,120
would it be possible to ask the non-vegan to give 
us feedback on the conversation they had well

1437
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:31,839
we kind of do at the end we say what do you 
think you'll do that gives you the answer

1438
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:45,840
and danya if i'm saying 
you're not your name correctly  

1439
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:48,400
dania could you also point out the tip about

1440
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:52,799
open-ended questions are generally preferred  

1441
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:58,160
to anchor and progress the conversation you 
should you should use closed-ended questions and  

1442
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:02,880
statements so we're not saying use open-ended 
questions all the time that's just ridiculous

1443
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:13,840
but generally they are preferred i'm 
going to move on now to the next slide  

1444
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:23,200
you versus we we don't torture animals and kill 
animals for products non-vegans do using we  

1445
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:29,200
undermines individual accountability when you tell 
non-vegans that we as a society are responsible  

1446
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:35,359
for animal cruelty in farms it takes away the 
imperative for the individual accountability it  

1447
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:44,160
makes them think of lobbying government programs 
etc instead of personal responsibilities people  

1448
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:48,880
need to feel guilty to change they'll only change 
once they understand that there is a difference  

1449
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:55,840
between you the vegan and them the non-vegan 
and that difference needs to be very clear

1450
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:09,840
30 seconds

1451
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:28,960
i can add and say that guilt is the only way 
in my opinion to get people to go vegan not  

1452
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:34,080
plant-based but transform them into a vegan 
activist that's gonna change the [ __ ] world

1453
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,840
amen

1454
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:52,160
um can we mean i was in the same boat as 
the non-vegan well that's the thing it's  

1455
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:58,559
being used that way but when you say we you no 
longer do it so it's just completely inaccurate  

1456
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,680
you're making an inaccurate statement 
in an effort to seem more humble  

1457
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:10,000
which is really just trying to be liked 
which is really focusing on getting  

1458
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,399
compassion from the abusers as opposed to 
focusing your compassion on the victims

1459
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,840
does that help

1460
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:42,479
all right moving on thank you for your comments 
guys but um i'm going to move on so on to the next  

1461
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:45,679
people already know how to go 
vegan this is the why versus how  

1462
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:52,160
people already know how to go vegan with the 
constant availability of google and the internet  

1463
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:58,160
people are literally glued to their phones in 
2020. anybody can figure out how to become vegan  

1464
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:03,760
instantly in order for people to feel the need to 
become vegan they need to be held accountable for  

1465
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:11,520
why they said for why they should do it my vision 
is going blurry at this point i'll read that again  

1466
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:16,000
in order for people to feel the need to become 
vegan they need to be held accountable for  

1467
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:24,319
why they should do it with any other injustice you 
would never focus on the how by talking about how  

1468
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:31,600
to not participate in the violence so i'm 
reading this incorrectly let me start again  

1469
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,920
with any other injustice you would never 
focus on the how by talking about how  

1470
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:42,000
to not participate in the violence focusing on the 
how in the context of any other injustice would be  

1471
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:57,840
an insult to the victims and the entire movement 
fighting to end their oppression 30 seconds

1472
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:08,000
how do you convince intersectionals to 
be vegan intersectionals to be vegan  

1473
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:15,200
i'm assuming they're not vegan then usually i 
find intersectionals are vegan but if they're  

1474
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:19,519
if they're not even vegan you i would just 
say to talk to them like you talk to anybody

1475
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:25,840
else

1476
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:52,880
yes moving on guys thank you on to the next 
slide vegetarianism is cancer to animal rights  

1477
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:57,600
vegetarians are non-vegans and should be 
outreached in the same manner as anyone else  

1478
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:05,680
and in most cases even harder because vegetarians 
act so pompous vegetarians are our target market  

1479
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:10,640
they're no different to paleo eaters 
why should we treat them any differently

1480
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:21,280
they are not allies don't let other non-vegans 
and vegans manipulate you into thinking that  

1481
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:26,960
they are 30 seconds i don't have 
anything to add to these points if

1482
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:36,960
if i'm just moving straight into looking at 
the comments and it doesn't look like you guys

1483
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:42,000
want me to expand on this 
it's pretty straightforward

1484
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:54,000
all right five seconds vegetarians 
are proper carnists yeah well said  

1485
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:59,360
they should get tenfold harsher 
activism especially if they're pompous  

1486
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,960
especially if they're pompous all right 
moving on typical outreach structure ask  

1487
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:10,399
them if they would like to know why 
you're here this was asked earlier  

1488
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:16,720
ask them if they would like to know why you're 
here and with the context of the footage playing  

1489
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:22,399
tell them what the cube of truth sets out to 
do what we are doing is showing the reality of  

1490
02:44:22,399 --> 02:44:27,920
what happens to animals and the meat dairy 
egg and other industries everything you see  

1491
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:34,480
here is standard practice here and around the 
world asking the following open-ended question  

1492
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:40,640
what are your feelings on animal abuse 
then confirm their stance to form moral  

1493
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:59,840
consistency with something like so it's safe to 
say that you are against animal abuse 30 seconds

1494
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:13,840
hmm

1495
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,320
moving on

1496
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:26,319
we're nearly nearly finished 
with these slides also guys  

1497
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:30,799
typical outreach structure ask them do 
they think it's possible to be against  

1498
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:34,160
animal abuse while demanding 
products like meat dairy and eggs

1499
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:43,200
i don't think we covered this in the uh 
presentation but this is a powerful point  

1500
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:47,679
i'm going to read it again ask them do you 
think it's possible to be against animal  

1501
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:55,040
abuse while demanding products like meat dairy 
and eggs ask them what is stopping them from  

1502
02:45:55,040 --> 02:46:01,120
not abusing animals and being vegan what 
do you feel like would be stopping you from  

1503
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:09,840
not abusing animals and being vegan this 
will lead to their objections 30 seconds

1504
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:18,559
how to respond if they 
don't consider those footage  

1505
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:25,439
wow let me read this question out um how to 
respond if people don't consider the footage  

1506
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:31,359
to be animal abuse you have no conversation to be 
having with that person move on to the next person  

1507
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:44,480
if blood flying everywhere and heads being cut 
off is not animal abuse if baby male chicks if  

1508
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:52,799
baby chicks are being grinded alive in a big 
blender and they don't think that's animal abuse

1509
02:46:55,439 --> 02:47:02,319
you're not talking to a rational person so i would 
say you need to move on to the next person jezebel

1510
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:09,440
if they say they don't care about animal 
abuse is it best just to end the conversation  

1511
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:18,719
i would say what if you were the one being 
abused would you care then or it's easy to  

1512
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:24,960
say when you're the abuser what if you were the 
one being abused that's the upgrade there for you

1513
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:32,800
and then move on if it goes 
downhill from there because  

1514
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:36,640
this is not a rational open and 
willing person you're speaking to

1515
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:48,319
carlo recently you said in a video 
we have to avoid the word vegan i'm  

1516
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:53,439
a little confused about it now so you suggest 
to openly say we are promoting veganism or not  

1517
02:47:54,399 --> 02:47:58,719
i never said to not use the word vegan in 
fact i say i said that i used the word vegan  

1518
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:06,000
it's just what i'm saying carlo is that 
it's far more effective for us to explain  

1519
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:10,720
what the meaning like to say 
human supremacy or animal abuse  

1520
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:21,439
you know to detail what it really means to be 
vegan like if in this point um if i mean at  

1521
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:26,399
this point in the conversation you're saying if 
we are saying that we're promoting veganism um

1522
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:33,760
this is it depends this is something that i would 
say if someone says you're promoting vegetarianism  

1523
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:38,480
i would correct that and say we're not promoting 
vegetarianism because that doesn't address the  

1524
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:46,319
issue at all we're promoting veganism so i would 
not shy away from saying the word vegan however  

1525
02:48:46,319 --> 02:48:51,519
it's usually best for you to talk about what that 
word actually means than to just use the word  

1526
02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:58,240
why because the word has a lot of confusion 
around it within the animal rights movement  

1527
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:02,560
you can see how there's so 
many definitions flying around  

1528
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:05,920
and that's why we started this with 
the definition of veganism itself

1529
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:13,680
even if they are killed quickly it is 
still animal abuse of course because again  

1530
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:20,320
if you were the victim it is still abuse to take 
your life even if it's done quickly of course  

1531
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:27,759
you would see it as abuse in that circumstance you 
know the jews who were killed in the concentration  

1532
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:31,840
camps if they were gassed and killed quickly 
that doesn't make the injustice any less worse

1533
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:47,279
cool um moving on next slide objection handling 
whenever a bystander brings up an objection  

1534
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:51,200
place them in the victim's position 
and allow them to analyze the objection  

1535
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:56,399
from that perspective every single time 
this happens the objection will fall apart  

1536
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:03,440
most objections are easy and quick to respond 
to some are more nuanced and require a deeper  

1537
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:09,599
explanation but they should still be quick to 
respond to your response should always anchor  

1538
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:21,840
back to individual accountability this can't be 
more simple this is so simple again 30 seconds

1539
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:49,840
all right moving on

1540
02:50:52,240 --> 02:50:57,760
bring it back to the individual if they try to 
create excuses that try to remove accountability  

1541
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:06,640
for example pointing to rural communities lions 
low income families etc don't get lost in lengthy  

1542
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:12,880
explanations bring it back to the individual 
by placing themselves in the victims position  

1543
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:18,480
and asking how that excuse justifies their 
personal contribution to animal abuse

1544
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,840
i don't know if contribution is the right word  

1545
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:26,640
i might update that but you 
guys know what this is saying

1546
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:37,679
uh yeah 30 seconds i'm gonna 
shave five seconds off that so 25

1547
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:45,840
seconds

1548
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:59,840
objections are good they can 
be good yes they can be good

1549
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:06,640
all right moving on next slide

1550
02:52:11,439 --> 02:52:18,319
um tying the benefit tying the benefit only 
once they concede by saying if they're against  

1551
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:22,799
animal abuse then it's not possible to be 
against animal abuse while supporting it  

1552
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:29,200
the number one benefit of going vegan for the 
animals the benefit is that they no longer have  

1553
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:36,479
to be tortured and abused because of you for 
you if you say you are against animal abuse  

1554
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:41,839
and what you see on the screens then when you're 
vegan you no longer have to be a hypocrite  

1555
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:49,679
and so we're going to update this part like i said 
to say when you're vegan you have the opportunity  

1556
02:52:50,720 --> 02:53:00,080
for the first time in your life to not be 
a hypocrite so that's the update there when  

1557
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:05,040
you're vegan you now have the opportunity 
to no longer be a hypocrite this drives home  

1558
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:09,840
the accountability and makes them understand 
the consequence of their actions 30 seconds

1559
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:33,600
wow this has gone on for ages i saw it like five 
hours ago govi well jen you know i'm trying to  

1560
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:40,880
make sure that this workshop is as thorough 
as possible but we're almost about to wrap up

1561
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,880
do people only care about being 
hypocrites yeah because it affects  

1562
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:54,719
people care about themselves 
and the image of themselves and  

1563
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:00,560
if you want to hit people and and mess up 
their ego about themselves that's how you  

1564
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:04,480
do it you you call them out on things like 
this and this is unfortunately how people  

1565
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:10,559
work i mean i wish that it was just as 
easy as saying guys we have 50 less than  

1566
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:15,440
50 years left on this planet animal abuse is 
the biggest pressing issue of our time we have  

1567
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:20,719
no right to be abusing animals please stop 
if that was it was just as easy as that

1568
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,960
i would i would that's what i would be telling 
you to do in this outreach workshop but it's not  

1569
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:29,121
moving on

1570
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:36,720
26 all right close the conversation 
always end outreach conversations  

1571
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:44,480
by asking what the individual will personally 
do to take action ask them open and ask  

1572
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:50,319
the open-ended question after our conversation 
what are you going to do about this injustice  

1573
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:57,439
after a long conversation they may still 
say that they'll only reduce or do nothing  

1574
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:03,279
if they can if you can sense that the 
interaction will keep going in circles  

1575
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:15,840
end the conversation with the statement 30 seconds

1576
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:35,280
from a outsider point of view this vegan 
approach is genius david velas is in the comments  

1577
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:45,760
and seems effective and david is not vegan joining 
us and giving his feedback on this approach  

1578
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:52,240
i appreciate it david i appreciate your 
feedback but you know that this is going to be  

1579
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:56,000
a huge thing for you that you have to 
face because this whole conversation  

1580
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:01,920
if you're telling us it's effective what we 
really want to know is how effective is it for you

1581
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,000
all right let's move on

1582
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:13,519
so this is the last slide guys

1583
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:20,720
closing the conversation an effective statement 
in this situation can be so keep in mind that for  

1584
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:25,680
however long that you're not vegan animals 
will be abused and tortured because of you  

1585
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:30,640
so when you're ready to stop abusing animals 
and align your actions with your words  

1586
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:36,241
you know what to do so think about what side 
of history you want to stand on and that closed  

1587
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:41,599
um that closes the conversation but this is also  

1588
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:53,840
the question that we have for you david this 
question is for you what are you going to do

1589
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:08,000
your question david i'm not sure on  

1590
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,240
uh how would i respond to someone 
saying that they would hire animals

1591
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:19,520
it's i don't i've never heard that before but 
hiring i'm not sure if you've used the wrong word  

1592
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:24,720
there but hiring animals is still exploitation 
that's just another word for enslaving animals

1593
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:29,040
but i'm not quite sure i 
understand your question there

1594
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:38,081
and this is the end of this live stream 
and this workshop so i want to thank you
