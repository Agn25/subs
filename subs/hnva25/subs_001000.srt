00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,360
## when we promote animal rights it should be about 
## animal rights why do we think people care about  




92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,280
## either their health or the environment most people 
## in the streets do not care about their health  




93
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,880
## nor the environment so rooting out outreach 
## in these topics will marginalize the animals  




94
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,280
## health and environment have become exacerbated 
## because people do not take animal abuse  




95
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,120
## seriously trying to hook people with an approach 
## that revolves around what benefits them does a  




96
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,960
## disservice to the animals so focus on the 
## root cause of the issue the animal abuse  




97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,840
## whenever people talk about how badly our 
## environment is affected by animal agriculture  




98
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,800
## whether it's someone who is vegan or non-vegan 
## talking about these points and by the way  




99
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,640
## most non-vegans already know about how bad 
## animal agriculture is for the environment why  




100
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,600
## do they know about this there are so many victims 
## involved in this injustice that it does in fact  




101
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,720
## impact the environment so the root cause of this 
## issue is animal abuse and so it makes no sense to  




102
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,160
## talk about the symptom and to make this again 
## a selfish message for humans to benefit from




103
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,960
## why don't people care about ethics




104
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
## because vegans don't advocate 
## for animals correctly  




105
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,600
## they focus on things like plant-based recipes 
## restaurants weight loss or deforestation another  




106
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,920
## reason is they lead with phrases like friends 
## not food or animal lovers don't eat animals  




107
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,320
## this is not a conversation about sympathy 
## this is a conversation about accountability  




108
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,720
## don't plead with bystanders make them 
## understand the consequences of their choices  




109
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,360
## by placing them in the victim's position morality 
## when it comes to this injustice and injustice in  




110
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,840
## general you can say but especially when it 
## comes to this injustice is black and white  




111
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
## if bystanders tell you that you aren't 
## considering the other side to this or that you  




112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,640
## aren't open-minded enough that is a distraction 
## there is no other side to needless animal abuse  




113
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,920
## you either support it or you don't don't get lost 
## in these distractions compare animal abuse to a  




114
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,720
## comparable injustice and get it back on track when 
## you're comparing animal abuse to another injustice  




115
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,400
## we've found that the best thing to do is to 
## compare it to them put the bystander in that  




116
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,640
## cow's position how would you feel your babies 
## were being stolen from you after you were raped  




117
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,360
## and you had your neck sliced open what i found 
## is that most people mostly care about themselves  




118
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,920
## you know they're not really going to understand 
## unless they imagine for themselves what it would  




119
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,800
## be like if they were in that position if we want 
## them to connect to what animals are going through  




120
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,440
## which injustice should you compare to i just 
## touched on this a little bit but we'll get  




121
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,360
## further into it it is most effective to compare 
## the to injustices such as child abuse or human  




122
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,320
## trafficking but even better the most effective is 
## to place the bystander in the victim's position  




123
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,960
## avoid dog comparisons this goes back to not 
## leading with compassion it's not about the  




124
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,560
## love that people feel towards animals it's about 
## the hate that they feel towards injustice i can't  




125
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,360
## tell you how many times i've personally learned 
## this lesson about using dogs as a comparison  




126
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,200
## and people will say yeah well if i was in china i 
## would eat dogs here's the thing most people don't  




127
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,360
## view dogs truly as individuals one indication of 
## that in our society is that we have dog shelters  




128
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,320
## that kill dogs by the thousand and so again 
## most people mostly only care about themselves  




129
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,720
## it doesn't come down to whether you can 
## imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse  




130
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
## it comes down to whether you can 
## imagine yourself in a slaughterhouse  




131
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,400
## statistics keep them minimal outside of what is 
## asked of you state minimal information during  




132
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,400
## outreach conversations we are not on the streets 
## to verbally leaflet let the footage provide the  




133
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,920
## context to the conversation you aren't at a cube 
## of truth to be a statistician you're there to  




134
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,760
## have a concise conversation that holds people 
## to account for their unjustified animal abuse  




135
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,600
## a conversation will go on for longer than 
## necessary if it turns into an argument over  




136
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,760
## statistics and it's not to say that we can't 
## win these debates we can we have logic and facts
