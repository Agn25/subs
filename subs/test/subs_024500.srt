02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:11,359
## that story sickens me as much as the stories 
## that meat cheese milk and egg eaters love to  




1314
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:18,559
## tell hey gary i only eat free range freedom eggs 
## hey gary i only eat animals who are raised and  




1315
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:27,279
## killed humanely on a cage-free organic farm there 
## is no such thing as humane when it comes to meat  




1316
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:38,880
## cheese milk and eggs humane slaughter humane rape 
## humane slavery humane holocaust do not exist and  




1317
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:46,560
## if for some reason my aforesaid words and the 
## video we just watched aren't proof enough of  




1318
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:53,920
## the terrorism claims that i am loving against the 
## meat dairy and egg industries and humanity itself  




1319
02:45:55,279 --> 02:46:01,679
## i don't know maybe the billions of dead 
## dismembered animal bodies could count  




1320
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:11,519
## as proof peace begins at the dinner table with 
## what you put into your body on a daily basis good  




1321
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:20,400
## people don't talk about kindness they practice it 
## they don't pray about love they actually give it  




1322
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:27,599
## i know you have the capability of understanding 
## right from wrong because you all hate people  




1323
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:35,760
## who harm children why not despise people who 
## harm animals it's hypocritical why protect one  




1324
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:44,080
## and violate the other when neither one wants nor 
## deserves the abuse they just wish it would end




1325
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:51,840
## up




1326
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,840
## foreign




1327
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,920
## uh you will hear the translation in your  




1328
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:15,279
## ear and when we talk to you we'll 
## translate simultaneously as best




1329
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:33,840
## foreign




1330
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:47,840
## foreign




1331
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:27,440
## one of the fears of the ministry of 
## education is the way that you choose to um to  




1332
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:35,439
## provoke your agenda i think and in schools they 
## might they might think that it's inappropriate  




1333
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:40,879
## what do you think first of all i'm here to speak 
## on behalf of the most oppressed most abused most  




1334
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:46,560
## murdered group of beings that has ever existed the 
## animals i speak against speciesism in the same way  




1335
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:52,160
## nelson mandela spoke against racism in the same 
## way dr martin luther king and malcolm x and rosa  




1336
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:58,479
## parks spoke against the evils of racism and when 
## we teach children that the jewish holocaust was  




1337
02:49:58,479 --> 02:50:04,080
## evil but then we send animals to their death to 
## the slaughterhouses and the same extermination
