00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,760
## other beings you know that are more oppressed than 
## themselves and that doesn't take away from their  




445
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:17,440
## pain or their suffering that's how i see it i 
## mean how more audacious could you possibly be  




446
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:26,480
## as a human being any human being to say 
## you're more oppressed than a group of beings  




447
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:37,200
## enslaved tortured and murdered by the trillion 
## with a t every year when was the last genocide  




448
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:49,360
## of one billion with a b humans oh wait crickets 
## a billion i'm talking three trillion with a t  




449
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,160
## are subjected to this injustice every single year 
## it's happening every second of every day doesn't  




450
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,520
## need to be explained to vegans of course but hello 
## don't get mad at us for being a medium of truth  




451
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,160
## yeah i think um just to add to that i think this 
## is this is a point that i i agree on i mean i'm i  




452
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,760
## guess i'm not supposed to be sharing my personal 
## views here i am interviewing you but i have to  




453
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,960
## say i agree with you because um i don't believe 
## that it's down to emotions this point i believe  




454
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,840
## it's down to the facts and it's objectively 
## true it's it's it's not something that can  




455
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,480
## even be argued against and anyone who's tried to 
## argue against even with me the arguments it just  




456
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,080
## falls to pieces because you can't possibly claim 
## that any other animal on the planet is abused  




457
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,720
## or any any human animal on the planet is abused or 
## or exploited or objectified more than a non-human  




458
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,240
## the non-humans don't even have political rights or 
## voices like it's it's not even about how much they  




459
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,040
## say even if we forget how many of them are abused 
## in the severity the fact that they literally have  




460
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:00,640
## no say at all in their own lives um like none 
## none whatsoever no legal almost no legal rights  




461
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,160
## you know um it's it's enough you know it's enough 
## to just even go from that even if it wasn't three  




462
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,440
## trillion that alone is enough of a point you know 
## but at that and the fact there's three trillion  




463
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,080
## of them being you know horrifically murdered 
## it's it's it's yeah it's a crazy point to try to  




464
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,960
## to try to argue against that in my opinion and i'm 
## always surprised when vegans try to argue against  




465
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,040
## it it's i mean i mean nothing really surprises 
## me anymore actually but but yeah it's slightly  




466
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,880
## more surprised with that um i've got a question 
## uh do you think this is this came from a a uh  




467
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
## instagramer i think uh do you think it's 
## speciesist to ignore human oppression while  




468
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,840
## fighting for non-human animals that was that was 
## a question that somebody wanted to ask you guys




469
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,200
## you know i know that people aren't 
## attuned to nuance and context but  




470
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,960
## it is required for us to answer this 
## question uh as a general statement yeah like  




471
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,520
## the way you ask that of course not like yeah 
## sorry the question was is it is it speciesist  




472
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,960
## do you think it yeah do you think it is personally 
## do you find it to be is that is that an example  




473
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,400
## of speciesism basically yes when i hear that 
## question as a blanket statement like that yes  




474
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:31,520
## because it sounds like otherwise you're going to 
## say otherwise you're denying that group of things  




475
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,720
## like their existence and their suffering and 
## their oppression so yeah of course it is but  




476
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,440
## yeah like we need an example or an explanation 
## of why because is that because again because  




477
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,320
## av is 100 focused on non-human animals or is this 
## question directed at us personally and people are  




478
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,280
## wondering if we do other forms of activism or we 
## care about other poison forms of injustice every  




479
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,480
## every day we make a post on social media about 
## non-human animals every day we set up cube of  




480
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,240
## truth action on the streets those energies are 
## spent on fighting for non-human animals while  




481
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,760
## human injustices are occurring within human human 
## to human injustices are occurring around the world  




482
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,920
## at that time so if at a general level you 
## want to say because of our answer we're  




483
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
## technically ignoring all of these other 
## injustices while we're doing that well  




484
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,920
## there's no such there's no point of even 
## trying to like there's no nuance at all  




485
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,640
## in a way that someone would think if 
## that's the conclusion they're trying  




486
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,920
## yeah yeah i think i would add to that and i 
## don't think it's speciesism because you're not uh  




487
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,880
## you're not not fighting for humans i'm not i'm not 
## not fighting for humans because i think humans are  




488
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,120
## somehow inferior i'm choosing to fight for 
## non-humans because i believe that well not  




489
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,680
## i believe they are um in more need simple as that 
## so that's my how i answer that question is is that
