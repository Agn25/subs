00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,920
## pollute their environment destroy their habitat is 
## there a reason we have to maximize the suffering  




164
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
## and maximize the cruelty and the 
## death that they already endure  




165
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,840
## by eating them on top of it all you want to talk 
## about pouring salt into somebody else's womb  




166
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:30,000
## 98 and i repeat this stat 98 of animals who are 
## abused and killed on this planet are abused and  




167
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,600
## killed by the meat dairy and egg industries 
## this is where all the harm is taking place and  




168
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,680
## in america from birth until death each meat eater 
## consumes around 3 000 land animals and thousands  




169
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,120
## of other marine animals those are usda stats 
## now with all this being said we've established  




170
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,080
## the four reasons why people eat meat cheese 
## milk and eggs no debating no discussing them




171
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:09,680
## have it tradition convenience taste it now 
## i want to get back to taste good though  




172
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,560
## because i think meat tastes great it might shock 
## you to hear me say that but if you're doing some  




173
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,440
## kind of extra credit essay on my speech you 
## want to quote me quote me right now i love  




174
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:32,560
## the way meat tastes love it cheese love it 
## cow's milk and eggs love it guilty as charged  




175
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,520
## i did not stop eating this stuff because of 
## the taste issue i stopped for ethics morality  




176
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,480
## decency how come when i talk about mock meat i 
## always catch a handful of people in every crowd  




177
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
## and we got a big crowd today so i stopped counting 
## at about eight or nine how come there's always a  




178
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,920
## handful of people that wrinkle up their noses make 
## big wide eyes and start glancing at the people  




179
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,360
## next to them across the aisle like soy chicken 
## is this guy crazy soy bacon he must be out of his  




180
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:14,640
## mind how come this stuff that is made of soy wheat 
## vegetables grains and spices contrary to the lies  




181
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,080
## being spread about these products by the meat and 
## dairy industries how come this stuff is considered  




182
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,160
## gross to most people but meat meat's got five 
## components let me break it down for you blood  




183
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,680
## flesh veins muscles and tendons the cut up 
## corpse of a dismembered body how does meat  




184
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,720
## not qualify as gross and disgusting everybody 
## how in the world is a beverage a liquid that  




185
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,680
## oozes out of the others of cows a secretion that 
## drips from the mammary glands of another being  




186
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,360
## that's loaded with pus by the way oh yeah let 
## me tell you how the pus in your child milk it'd  




187
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,720
## be my pleasure when you hook machines up to the 
## others of cows three times a day to suck them dry  




188
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,280
## those machines cause massive amounts of infections 
## on the inside and outside of the utter now let's  




189
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,960
## add all the bovine growth hormone they put in cows 
## to make sure they produce huge quantities of milk  




190
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,920
## which always leads to another infection the 
## machine doesn't know what not to suck out  




191
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,720
## pus mucus and infections right in with your 
## milk and yeah milk is pasteurized but when did  




192
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,400
## pasteurization become a removal process it's a 
## sanitation process you're only sanitizing pus  




193
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,040
## and you want to look this up online you 
## don't think the dairy industry would ever  




194
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,960
## use the word pus when they write about 
## this problem in their own trade journals  




195
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,200
## and they're going to deceive you again with 
## this look up the scientific term for pus  




196
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,680
## somatic cell count and by the way our 
## government the usda they allow the dairy  




197
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,640
## industry to have a maximum amount of one eye 
## dropper full of pus in every glass another  




198
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,080
## drink up does anybody know what an egg actually 
## is from a hand and don't say embryo or aborted  




199
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,520
## fetus not even close it's unfertilized so 
## it can't be either hen is a female though  




200
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,800
## unfertilized egg through a female system it's 
## part of her menstruation cycle it's a hens  




201
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
## period people scramble up hand periods in the 
## morning and all of a sudden i'm weird because i  




202
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,240
## don't make omelets anymore and what about vomit oh 
## we're going to take those blinders off today come  




203
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,480
## on you guys love vomit you adore it all over your 
## food got you give this one a pretty name though




204
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,840
## no one's gonna buy and eat vomit unless we call 
## it honey instead honey comes directly from a  




205
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,760
## bee's stomach it is regurgitated right through a 
## bee's mouth look it up with any wildlife biologist  




206
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,320
## but nobody wants to eat bee bonnet and 
## nut cheerios we want honey nut cheerios  




207
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,360
## so we hire ourselves to play euphemism games the 
## standard diet of a meat eater is blood flesh veins  




208
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,640
## muscles tendons cow secretions hen periods and b 
## vomit now we're not done yet i am not going to let
