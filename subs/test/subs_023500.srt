02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:07,040
## now according to government regulations free-range 
## chickens raised for their flesh or for their eggs  




1214
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:13,439
## are only required to have access to an outside 
## area meaning that most of these birds never  




1215
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:19,040
## even get to see the light of day because having 
## access and actually being allowed getting to go  




1216
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,399
## outside are two completely different things 
## now even if these birds manage to fight their  




1217
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:29,920
## way outside these outside areas they're given 
## are usually no bigger than a standard backyard  




1218
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:35,200
## so that's a few thousand chickens in a single 
## backyard how much happy space would you have  




1219
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:41,840
## if you had to share your backyard with a few 
## thousand people the term free range is a scam and  




1220
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:47,120
## all free range chickens end up dead anyway they 
## really don't seem that free to me but the term  




1221
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:52,880
## free range is used to trick people into believing 
## that meat and egg production can be done happily  




1222
02:35:52,880 --> 02:36:00,000
## and humanely but really the only happy and humane 
## way is just not to kill them i want to talk about  




1223
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:06,479
## cattle ranching for a moment because each year 
## in america we kill and eat about 37 million cows  




1224
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:12,000
## and at first these animals are allowed to graze on 
## large grassy fields for about six months but after  




1225
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:18,880
## that it's straight to the feedlot where there's 
## no grass no enclosed shelter just dirt and piles  




1226
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:24,960
## and piles and piles of manure and these feedlots 
## have anywhere from a few hundred to a hundred  




1227
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:31,280
## thousand cows there now for about ten months on 
## the feed lot the cows get fed corn and protein  




1228
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:36,479
## supplements to fatten them up quickly but 
## many other things get mixed into their feed  




1229
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:44,559
## many things you should be aware of many nasty 
## things like manure animal blood and the ground  




1230
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:49,040
## up bodies of animals who didn't grow quickly 
## enough are the ones that died from disease  




1231
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,439
## before they reach the slaughterhouse the 
## downed animals this is why mad cow disease and  




1232
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:59,359
## other animal diseases like avian bird flu should 
## concern everyone who eats meat because it is still  




1233
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:05,120
## perfectly legal and the standard operating 
## procedure of the meat industry to feed the  




1234
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:11,840
## diseased ground up bodies of horses pigs chickens 
## and turkeys back to the cows the sheep and the  




1235
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:18,319
## goats and vice versa anything to save a buck now 
## turkeys and ducks and sheep and other animals  




1236
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:24,160
## they go through the same barbaric treatment too 
## like chickens turkeys have a portion of their  




1237
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:29,200
## beak sliced off of the red hot blade while 
## ducks and geese have long steel poles shoved  




1238
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:35,040
## down their throats to force feed them to fatten 
## up their livers to ten times their natural size  




1239
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:42,160
## after killing them their liver is then turned 
## into a pate known as foie gras and sheep in the  




1240
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:47,519
## wool industry when these gentle creatures can 
## no longer produce good quality wool any more  




1241
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:52,560
## profitable to the clothing industry they're killed 
## too because bottom line when it's time to make a  




1242
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:58,800
## profit off an animal or that animal's body is 
## no longer profitable the meat dairy egg and  




1243
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:04,160
## clothing industries always always put a bullet 
## between the animal's eyes or slice their throat




1244
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:12,319
## now of the 18 billion marine animals that are 
## killed and eaten in america every year many  




1245
02:38:12,319 --> 02:38:17,519
## of them believe it or not were raised on fish 
## farms where they were genetically engineered  




1246
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:23,680
## fish farm salmon they have fish farms nowadays 
## miracles of science the rest of these aquatic  




1247
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:27,760
## animals are either hooked by the mouth or 
## they're netted in huge trawlers which are  




1248
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:33,359
## basically just giant high-powered vacuum cleaners 
## and they'll suck up catch and kill anything and  




1249
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:38,719
## everything that happens to be in its path now 
## to demonstrate to you folks why we believe that  




1250
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:44,320
## fishing is cruel violent and unethical we've 
## come up with an analogy to help you empathize  




1251
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:50,000
## now imagine for a moment that you're taking 
## a walk on a warm pretty bright sunny day  




1252
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,080
## down a nice dirt country back 
## road and you spot an apple tree  




1253
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:58,399
## fruit tree and you're hungry you've been walking 
## for a while so you reach up for a piece of fruit  




1254
02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:04,160
## but suddenly your hand is impaled by a large 
## metal hook that pulls you and drags you now  




1255
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:09,439
## please keep in mind that's the whole entire weight 
## of your body pulling and dragging on your one hand  




1256
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:15,759
## pulling and dragging you out of the air and 
## into an atmosphere in which you cannot breathe  




1257
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:21,760
## see that is exactly what aquatic animals 
## experience when they're removed from their  




1258
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:27,760
## watery habitats folks all we're really asking 
## of you of anyone that we ever do this lecture  




1259
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:34,399
## for to actually do is just eat what comes from 
## the ground okay that's it and believe me it is  




1260
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:41,439
## natural it is full of vitamins minerals nutrients 
## protein calcium iron potassium anything and  




1261
02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:46,479
## everything that the human body needs comes from 
## the ground really that's where it all comes from  




1262
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:51,519
## fruits and vegetables nuts seeds grains legumes 
## tofu even though i know that's still a funny word  




1263
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:58,240
## to a lot of people see these things cannot harm 
## you now when you eat what walks on the ground  




1264
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:05,120
## that is unnatural it is full of death disease 
## and violence the human body does not get what
