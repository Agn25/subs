00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,920
## cool and with the context of the footage playing 
## tell them what the cube of truth sets out to do  




272
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,560
## what we are here doing is showing the reality 
## of what happens to animals in the meat dairy and  




273
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,280
## egg industries and also other industries 
## that exploit animals everything you see  




274
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,440
## here is standard practice here and around the 
## world what we're showing on these screens is  




275
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,000
## the standard practice for what happens in the meat 
## industry in this country but also around the world




276
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,320
## these are the farms and the slaughterhouses 
## that label themselves free range grass fed  




277
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,280
## cage free organic ask the following open-ended 
## question what are your feelings on animal abuse  




278
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,080
## then confirm their stance to form moral 
## consistency with something like so is it  




279
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,400
## safe to say that you are against animal 
## abuse how does the footage make you feel




280
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,600
## it makes you feel bad are you both against animal 
## abuse yes by the way most people will say yes  




281
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,560
## it's very rare that you'll get 
## anybody that says no to that question  




282
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
## ask them do you think it's possible to be 
## against animal abuse while demanding products  




283
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,880
## like meat dairy and eggs do you think 
## it's possible to be against animal abuse  




284
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,960
## while eating meat dairy or eggs and this is where 
## the truth starts to set in and most people say  




285
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,920
## that's a really good question or their objections 
## start to come out ask them what is stopping them  




286
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,760
## from not abusing animals and becoming vegan what 
## do you feel like would be stopping you and this  




287
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,320
## is important that you say what do you feel like 
## would be stopping you not what is stopping you  




288
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,560
## because there as you know nothing there is nothing 
## stopping anybody from going vegan really if you  




289
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,520
## live in a modern society what do you feel like 
## would be stopping you from not abusing animals  




290
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,320
## and being vegan it's also important 
## that you mention not abusing animals  




291
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,200
## and being vegan and not just saying what do you 
## feel like would be stopping you from being vegan  




292
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,440
## what do you feel like for you two as individuals 
## what do you feel like is holding you back from  




293
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,080
## not being responsible for any of this animal 
## abuse and living vegan it's much more powerful  




294
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,960
## to add in the fact that you're not abusing 
## animals when you're not vegan this will lead  




295
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,840
## to their objections objection handling whenever 
## a bystander brings up an objection place them  




296
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,520
## in the victim's position and allow them to 
## analyze the objection from that perspective  




297
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,280
## every single time this happens the objection 
## will fall apart you know as long as they're being  




298
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,080
## genuine they're not being disingenuous 
## intellectually no matter what the objection is  




299
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,080
## it always crumbles i'm still gonna make meat but 
## i'm gonna try and do it as humane as i can imagine  




300
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:01,680
## yourself in the animal's position how do i murder 
## you humanely is there a humane way for him to be  




301
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:09,840
## murdered i'm asking you now just so you can help 
## out maybe there isn't is there why do you say that




302
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,520
## yeah he's not consenting to being killed is he 
## he's not saying yes i'm okay with being killed you  




303
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,560
## wouldn't say that would you most objections are 
## easy and quick to respond to some are more nuanced  




304
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,720
## and require a deeper explanation but they should 
## still be quick to respond to your response should  




305
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:42,640
## always anchor back to individual accountability 
## it should always end up with the bystander you're  




306
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,880
## speaking with being in the hot seat if it doesn't 
## end up with that bystander being in the hot seat  




307
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
## you aren't anchoring that point that you've 
## just made correctly it has to always end there




308
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,160
## bring it back to the individual if they try to 
## create excuses that try to remove accountability  




309
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:10,720
## for example pointing to rural communities 
## lions low income families etc don't get lost  




310
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,440
## in lengthy explanations again these things are 
## distractions bring it back to the individual  




311
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,760
## by placing themselves in the victim's position and 
## asking how that excuse justifies their personal  




312
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,480
## responsibility to animal abuse i need to 
## update these slides to be completely honest  




313
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,120
## contribution and support aren't 
## the correct words to use here  




314
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,160
## people aren't merely contributing to the animal 
## holocaust they're literally responsible for it  




315
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,240
## i'm going to give you an example if 
## a hunter's wife is at home and before  




316
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,760
## the hunter goes out to have a day of hunting 
## the wife says have a great day hunting honey  




317
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,720
## she's supporting hunting but she's not 
## actually shooting the animals herself
