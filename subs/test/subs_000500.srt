00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,640
## we also don't wear animal skins no fur leather 
## wool silk or down now i want to let you all know  




43
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:22,240
## that i was not raised vegan i ate meat cheese 
## milk and eggs for around 25 years i used to wear  




44
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,120
## leather shoes and belts and jackets like everyone 
## else in fact around 20 years ago i even owned  




45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,360
## a fur coat needless to say i understand your 
## lifestyle it used to be mine and for people  




46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,960
## involved in politics let's get this out of the 
## way right now i am not a democrat an anarchist  




47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,920
## or some hippie with a closet full of tie dye 
## shirts i'm not a republican a socialist or a  




48
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:02,720
## fascist i'm an activist root word is active 
## i've been banned from five countries so far  




49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,600
## and arrested 13 times for random acts of kindness 
## and compassion on behalf of my animal brothers  




50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,520
## and sisters if you want to read up about that 
## check out my website and today i would love to  




51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,440
## give you a chance to actually do something and 
## truly get involved because i understand a lot of  




52
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,320
## people want to get involved honestly i do but 
## putting a co-exist bumper sticker on your car  




53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,680
## wearing a what would jesus do bracelet or 
## sporting a peace and love and sunshine t-shirt  




54
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,360
## that is not getting involved i understand 
## that we're all on a journey in life  




55
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,000
## we all have different likes and dislikes 
## different nationalities and religions  




56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,080
## too but there's one thing that we need to have in 
## common with each other and that's peace contrary  




57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:03,600
## to political and religious dogma animals do not 
## belong to us they are not commodities they're not  




58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,680
## property and they're not inanimate stupid objects 
## who can't think and feel that descartes cartesian  




59
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,800
## way of looking at animals like their machines it 
## is outdated and quite frankly 100 percent insane  




60
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:31,440
## because if we all understand that animals can 
## use their eyes to see ears to hear noses to smell  




61
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:42,480
## mouths to eat legs to walk feathers to fly fins to 
## swim genitalia to procreate bowels to defecate i'm  




62
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,240
## always perplexed and most people don't believe 
## that they can also use their brains to think  




63
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,200
## feel be rational be aware and be 
## self-aware am i supposed to believe  




64
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
## that every body part on an animal 
## functions just like it's supposed to  




65
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,680
## except the brain those lies are thick the 
## propaganda from the animal abusers is enormous  




66
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,440
## i mean when was the last time you turned on 
## tv and saw a commercial for shiitake mushrooms  




67
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,600
## people singing and dancing down the streets having 
## a good time eating mushrooms about alfalfa sprouts  




68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:36,720
## quinoa it's a seed radishes raspberries tofu you 
## don't see that stuff advertised on tv what do you  




69
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,440
## see instead have some more meat have some more 
## cheese have some more cheese on your meat meat  




70
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,560
## cheese double cheese extra cheese and how about a 
## little more cheese with your meat have some more  




71
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,080
## cow's milk have some more eggs and then what do 
## you see interspersed between those advertisements  




72
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
## not feeling so well need to see a cancer 
## specialist how about a heart doctor need some  




73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,160
## lipitor zocor crestor plavix needs some diet pills 
## how about some energy drinks some k.o pectate




74
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,080
## you've been duped and those blinders are on nice 
## and tightly but if you give me an open mind today  




75
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,560
## that's all i ask for an open mind i'm going to 
## take your blinders right up my goal is simple  




76
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,000
## all i want to do is reconnect people with animals 
## awaken some emotions and some feelings and some  




77
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,280
## logic that has been buried and suppressed 
## intentionally by our society and the reason  




78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,600
## why i say reconnect it's because each and 
## every person in this room used to be a real  




79
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,960
## animal rights person at one time a true animal 
## lover and a real friend of the animal kingdom  




80
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,080
## and it's when we were kids when we were young 
## we were kids man we used to be in all animals
