00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,240
## yes yes yeah okay would you take the position 
## that you just took with any other injustice




366
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,720
## let's say you're the victims in this scenario 
## would you find it acceptable for your oppressor  




367
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,480
## to try to harm you less and to do less harming 
## of you or would you want them to stop entirely




368
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,840
## immediately so please don't compromise 
## when it comes to these non-human animals  




369
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,320
## because they suffer just like you would if you 
## were in their position again they may not like  




370
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,000
## the sound of that um that it may not be what they 
## want to hear because essentially what they're  




371
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,120
## doing when they say i'm going to try or reduce 
## is they're pandering to you because they want  




372
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,760
## to tell you what you want to hear they can see 
## that they're in they're on the wrong side of this  




373
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,040
## that's why they're saying these things to 
## you to end the conversation you you become a  




374
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,720
## mirror at that point for the ugliness that they 
## represent and when you say that their stance is  




375
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,840
## not acceptable regardless of what they say after 
## that you've put the needle where it needs to be




376
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,000
## an effective statement in this situation can be 
## and this is the last line that we always give  




377
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,120
## people we tend to leave them with this so keep in 
## mind that for however long that you're not vegan  




378
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,360
## animals will be abused and tortured because of you 
## so when you're ready to stop abusing animals and  




379
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,280
## align your actions with your words you know what 
## to do think about what side of history you want to  




380
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,240
## stand on what i'd leave you guys with is just keep 
## in mind that for however long you're not vegan  




381
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,120
## unfortunately you guys are going to be 
## responsible for what's taking place on  




382
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,160
## the screen this animal abuse so just think 
## about and decide what side of history you  




383
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:12,000
## guys want to stand on when it comes to stamping 
## out this injustice and that's the workshop guys
