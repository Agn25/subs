02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:10,719
## the numbers are staggering about 45 to 50 billion 
## land animals and about 85 billion marine animals  




1166
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:16,560
## are killed and eaten every year on this planet now 
## in america we kill and eat more than 100 million  




1167
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:22,560
## pigs every single year and for their entire lives 
## the female pigs are locked up in tiny crates and  




1168
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:29,200
## stalls so they can be forcibly impregnated against 
## their will with long steel devices that shoot hog  




1169
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:35,280
## semen into their uterus basically they are the 
## unwilling baby machines of the meat industry  




1170
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,719
## and when female pigs can no longer make babies 
## after years of being forcibly impregnated  




1171
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:45,280
## they're shipped off to the slaughterhouse and 
## killed now meanwhile shortly after birth the  




1172
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:51,920
## male piglets they have their tiny bodies mutilated 
## in four horrific ways first somebody holds them  




1173
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:56,800
## upside down and cuts their tail off without 
## anesthetic because tail biting is common in  




1174
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:03,120
## the overcrowded unnatural conditions of today's 
## farms and then each baby pig has anywhere from  




1175
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:08,960
## two to eight teeth cut off they actually cut their 
## teeth off down to the gum line with a pair of wire  




1176
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:13,840
## cutter like devices so when they go to fight and 
## bite each other there are no teeth to damage the  




1177
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:20,080
## flesh and since female pigs are forced to produce 
## twice as many piglets in captivity than they  




1178
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:25,680
## would in the wild teeth cutting is also a big 
## money maker for the meat industry cutting teeth  




1179
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:31,439
## allows the mother to nurse even more piglets who 
## will eventually be killed for profit because when  




1180
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:36,719
## the babies suckle without teeth wear and tear 
## on the mother's nipples is kept to a minimum  




1181
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:40,880
## and they're always marking pigs to keep track 
## of them so they rip out portions of their ears  




1182
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:46,800
## it's called ear notching and then finally in 
## a sick attempt and i repeat a sick attempt to  




1183
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:53,600
## pacify the industry-induced anger of the male pigs 
## their testicles are ripped out as well and that's  




1184
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:59,920
## castration without anesthetic now castration 
## also gives the meat industry complete control  




1185
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:07,920
## over reproduction because natural reproduction in 
## the meat industry in this day and age is obsolete  




1186
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:14,800
## neither god nor evolution created 10 billion 
## land animals in this country alone every year  




1187
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:20,880
## human beings did that and that is because every 
## aspect of raising animals for food is controlled  




1188
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:26,160
## from genetic engineering and artificial 
## insemination to quoting and killing  




1189
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:31,280
## this is why many females empathize with the 
## animal rights movement and practice veganism  




1190
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:39,120
## humanitarian patrice jones once explained that 
## women and animals along with land and children  




1191
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:45,599
## have historically been seen as the property of 
## male households women and animals are viewed as  




1192
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:52,480
## less rational and both suffer by being reduced 
## to their bodies or even worse their body parts  




1193
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:59,679
## now of the 10 billion land animals killed and 
## eaten in america every year about 9 billion 9  




1194
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:07,040
## billion of those are chickens on egg farms they'll 
## stuff anywhere from five to eleven hens into each  




1195
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:13,920
## tiny battery cage with that many hens in a single 
## cage you can imagine fighting is very common  




1196
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:20,560
## which is why these hens have the top two thirds of 
## their beaks sliced off it's called de-beaking they  




1197
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:27,040
## actually slice off a portion of the beak with 
## a red-hot blade heated to 800 degrees celsius  




1198
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:32,640
## so that when they go to fight and peck each other 
## they have no beaks to damage each other's flesh  




1199
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:38,399
## and with chemicals and other drugs that are 
## injected into their feed each hen is forced to  




1200
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:45,439
## produce around 300 eggs every year until of course 
## her egg production tapers off and then she's  




1201
02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:52,799
## killed without exception each and every egg-laying 
## hen is killed so egg farms will also breed birds  




1202
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:58,240
## so there's always a fresh supply of hens to lay 
## the eggs but if babies in the hatchery turn out  




1203
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:03,599
## to be male pretty obvious they're completely 
## useless to an egg industry and they are killed  




1204
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:09,920
## off instantly they're either thrown into the 
## trash alive and crying out for their lost mothers  




1205
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:15,760
## or they're thrown into huge rendering machines 
## alive so that they can be ground up and used  




1206
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:21,680
## as feed for other animals on chicken farms 
## they'll have anywhere between twenty thousand  




1207
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:28,160
## and thirty thousand birds in each building 
## after six or seven weeks of concentration camp  




1208
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:35,519
## like conditions and living in tons of feces and 
## urine they are killed too their bodies are then  




1209
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:41,840
## soaked in a chlorine bath to remove the slime and 
## odor off their carcasses and then placed on your  




1210
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:48,640
## dinner plate see no one wants to admit it but 
## eating meat really does mean eating a dead body  




1211
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:54,719
## and eating meat means that your body has been 
## reduced to nothing more than a walking graveyard  




1212
02:34:54,720 --> 02:35:01,040
## of murdered animals and very quickly i want 
## to destroy this myth about free-range farms
