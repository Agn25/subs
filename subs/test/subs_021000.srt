02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:12,240
## does meat not qualify as disgusting and gross to 
## everybody how in the world is a liquid a liquid  




1009
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:19,520
## that oozes out of a cow's udder a secretion that's 
## loaded with pus that drips from an animal's body  




1010
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,920
## how is this not considered gross oh and let me 
## tell you about the pus in the cow's milk it could  




1011
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:29,200
## be my pleasure when you hook machines up to the 
## udders of cows three times a day to suck them dry  




1012
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:33,280
## those machines cause massive amounts of 
## infections and irritations on the inside  




1013
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:38,640
## and outside of the utter then when you add all 
## the bovine growth hormone and all the genetic  




1014
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:41,600
## engineering that's been done to a cow's body 
## to make sure she produces huge amounts of milk  




1015
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:46,800
## which always leads to another infection the 
## machine doesn't know what not to suck out pus  




1016
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:52,720
## and mucus and infections right into the milk 
## and yes milk is pasteurized but exactly when  




1017
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:59,200
## did pasteurization become a removal process 
## last time i checked it was a sanitation process  




1018
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:06,320
## meaning you're only sanitizing pus and if you 
## want to look this up online well you don't think  




1019
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:12,560
## the dairy industry would ever use the word pus 
## when they write about this problem in their own  




1020
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:18,320
## trade journals do you now they're going to deceive 
## you again look up the scientific term for pus  




1021
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:25,040
## somatic cell count s-o-m-a-t-i-c oh and 
## let's talk about some other disgusting  




1022
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:30,720
## things that you guys love to eat did you know 
## that the back side of a bird is called a cloaca




1023
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:37,840
## c-l-o-a-c-a it was the only scene in the video 
## you could pop that back in if you want to see  




1024
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:48,880
## it's one hole it is one whole but it serves 
## many purposes it's the poop hole it's the pee  




1025
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:56,960
## hole it's the vaginal fluid hole and it's the hole 
## where your omelettes and scrambled eggs come from  




1026

## yeah i remember back in the day used to love 
## my scrambled eggs with [ __ ] sprinkles urine  




1027

## ball all those microscopic particles fly 
## every which way and if you guys think it's  




1029
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:15,120
## normal and natural to eat something that's been 
## marinating in feces and urine for hours and hours  




1030
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,720

## call it honey instead honey comes directly from 
## a bee's stomach it's regurgitated right through  




1040
